### It's really not (yet?) fit for human consumption

On March 29th 2018, I had my body fat calculated via hydrostatic
weighing.  I was surprised that it was so high and I decided to try to
lose body fat to see how that would affect my life, including both my
mental abilities (I'm a professional computer programmer) and my
fitness (I was a search and rescue volunteer until January 1st, 2021
and I am an amateur ultra runner).

I started out with two files, [one](body_fat.txt) that documented the
stats that I got back from the University of New Mexico as well as my
interpretation of the stats and my plans (and results) of various
changes I made, and a few days later a simple text file that
documented [everything I ate](log/README.md).  Initially I tried to
calculate things like my caloric intake and the grams of protein I was
consuming and how many calories I was burning, but eventually I
decided just having a log of what, when and how much was sufficient to
keep me on the right track.

I've shared the food log with people a few times, because both my
weight loss (if you see me in person) and the resultant physical
performance boost (if you look at my [UltraSignup
results](http://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Clifford&lname=Matthews))
have been fairly substantial.  I had very mixed feelings about
sharing them with the public, but decided to do so as long as
everyone is aware that I'm not a doctor, dietitian, or coach.  I do
not recommend my diet to others as anything other than an "existence proof",
in that it documents my calories in and I appear to be fairly healthy, although
there's no guarantee that I'm not increasing my risk of cancer or heart
disease, stroke, etc.

For what it's worth, I've been vegan since 2012 (and vegetarian for
about thirty years before that), and supplement with B-complex, so I don't
think it's particularly likely that I'm nutritionally deficient,
because I think there's been long enough for such a deficiency to
negatively affect my performance if not my health.

Although I used to feel uncomfortable making this data public, I
eventually get over it.  I have a bunch of other data (i.e., I track
my daily training, typically running six days a week and bicycling on
the seventh) and I've made some of that available, beginning with an
overview of what I do is already available in my [Bataan Memorial
Death March](https://github.com/ctm/Bataan-Memorial-Death-March)
training log. [I joined
Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/58696205) when the response to
covid separated me from many people I was normally running with.
