1 cup of dry rice to 2 cups of water


3x
1 cup of cooked basmati brown rice to 32 oz. of water and 1/8th teaspoon of salt


I just tried using 3 cups water and 2 cups dry rice (having not seen my
note above).  I brought the water to a boil with the rice in it, then
took it down to 1 and left it there for a minute.  I then let it sit for
five minutes.

I don't yet know how many cups of cooked rice to fill the rice milk
container but I guess I'll find out soon.
