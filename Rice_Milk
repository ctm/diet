These instructions are for my stove, my Blentec and my container.  I
live in Albuquerque, which is a mile high.

First make the rice:

  1 cup of dry basmati rice and 2 cups of water.

  Bring the water with the rice in it to a boil,
  then turn it down to 4 and let it simmer for 40 minutes.

Then blend it:

  Repeatedly add 1 cup cooked rice to 32 oz. of water and add just
  a little less than 1/8th teaspoon of salt.  Do this until the
  container is full, then drink whatever is leftover in the Blendtec
  and eat whatever rice is leftover.
