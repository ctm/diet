1 cup of dry rice to 2 cups of water


3x
1 cup of cooked basmati brown rice to 32 oz. of water and 1/8th teaspoon of salt


I just tried using 3 cups water and 2 cups dry rice (having not seen my
note above).  I brought the water to a boil with the rice in it, then
took it down to 1 and left it there for a minute.  I then let it sit for
five minutes.

I don't yet know how many cups of cooked rice to fill the rice milk
container but I guess I'll find out soon.

========================================================================
I'm trying 1 1/2 cups basmati rice in 3 cups water
brought water to a boil, added rice, turned down to 3 and am leaving it
there for 35 minutes

35 minutes at 3 was not long enough for the rice to absorb all the water
I added 10 minutes, but there was water remaining. I'll try 4 next time
and use 40 minutes.

1 1/2 cups rice was about a half cup too much.  So next time I'll just
use one cup.  FWIW, my end product was a little too salty.  I may have
put in twice the salt, because my measuring spoons no longer have
readable labels.  Yay, lots of room for improvement.
