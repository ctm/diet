I lost my body fat page!

My recollection is that I was about 24%.  To err on the side of conservancy,
I'll say I was 23% even and that I weight 185.  If so, that means I had
44.55 % body fat and 142.45 is my non-fat weight.

I'd like to get to 12.9%

So, (100 - 12.9) / 100 * ideal_body_weight = 142.45
87.1 / 100 * ideal_body_weight = 142.45
ideal_body_weight = 142.45 * 100 / 87.1

That brings me to 163.54 pounds ... I'm skeptical that I should weigh
so little.  If my bf% was incorrect or if I've botched the reasoning
or math, that could be bad.  However, to get to 163.54, I need to go
through higher weights first, so let's plan on getting to 173.5 first
and see how my performance behaves as I get there, since that's about
what I'll get to as I go into my taper for Cruel Jewel.

April 18th

I've already dropped to 175 without any performance loss.  Assuming I
lost purely body fat (and I don't know how safe that assuption is), in
theory I'm now at 18.6% BF.  However, because I didn't actually
cross-calibrate my scale to the scale(s) they use at UNM, I could be off
by a few pounds.  As such, it probably makes sense to get my BF tested
again shortly after Cruel Jewel, both to see how much lean body mass I
lost (or gained!) as well as to cross-calibrate the scales.


May 10th

Found my body fat page.

I'm down to 167.5 pounds without any apparent performance loss.  Mark W.
and I would have gotten six ascents except there was a crime scene at
the turn off Tramway toward LLTH and we wound up helping out and being
detained for too long to make it worthwhile.  I ran the Run for the Zoo
1/2 marathon the following day (after doing 5 ascents) and got it done
in 1:55:49 and that included two porta potty stops and the slowdowns
associated with GI distress.

Anyway, my BF page says:

Body Weight: 185.5
Fat Weight 40.7
Fat Free Weight 144.8

BC Method: Hydrostatic weighing
Equation: Male Heward Compile

Body Density 1.04883 g/cc
RV: 2.075 L

Body Fat %: 21.95

So, my body weight for 12.9% would be 144.8 * 100 / 87.1 = 166.0
Seeing how I'm 167.5 and doing well, I'm thinking it would be better
to take myself down to 7.3%, which would be: 156.  That seems extreme
but is really just a BMI of 20, so I'll probably press onward.  At my
rate of weight loss for the last 30 days, that would require another
28 days of dieting, but I imagine that I'll pause my weight loss
during Cruel Jewel and may even regain some weight if I'm not careful
and that as I approach that weight I'll wind up losing more slowly, so
realistically I don't think I'll be able to get down to 156 until
early August, at earliest.  However, at 156, that means I can run
with a 30 pound pack at about the same weight I was running before
I lost my weight!




June 4th BF page

Body Weight: 159.6
Fat Weight: 23.3
Fat Free Weight: 136.3

Body Density: 1.06541 g/cc
RV: 2.070 (used to be 2.075?)

Body Fat % 14.61

Since March 29th:
67 days
25.9 pounds lost
2.70 pounds per week lost

If I were to not lose any muscle, going to 147 (i.e. losing 12.6 more
pounds) would take me to 7.3%.  However, I'll probably lose some more
muscle, so I probably need to lose more than 12.6, so going for 145 is
probably more realistic.

Our scale weighs 2.2 pounds high.  It had me at 162 when the scale at UNM
had me at 159.8.  NOTE: my weight above is listed as 159.6 because I took
a leak after weighing myself at 159.8 and after that leak I weighed 159.6.

June 13th

Just adding the 2.2 to 145 to show that my target is 147.25 *ON OUR SCALE*
meaning I have 12.5 more pounds to lose, which would be about six weeks

July 2nd

Haven't weighed as little as I did on June 13th, but might tomorrow
morning, depending on how big my poop is.  So, still about six weeks
out, but Baldy 50k may interfere w/ weight loss as well as any
tapering I do before Leadville and Leadville itself.  May be harder to
hit my goal by Tahoe 200 than I was thinking a month ago.

July 6th

Tied my low weight of 158.5, but I don't think it's an anomaly.  I suspect
I'll be < 159 tomorrow, too, whereas I bounced from 158.5 to 161 overnight
between the 10th and 11th.  Today was my fastest circa 130 BPM 13.1 mile
non-pack run (2:02:17, 131bpm).

July 16th new low of 157.25.  Taco Tuesday coming up, so that may be a
complication, but overall I think I'm dialing in losing weight while
eating more protein.

In theory I want to lose exactly ten pounds before I get
hydrostatically tested again, however that's going to take me past
BARGE and *probably* past Tahoe 200, both of which are likely to
interrupt my weight loss and cause even further delays.  It also means
I'll either still be trying to lose or only have stabilized recently
by the time my races start to pick up in September (Wounded Warrior
half, Tour de Cheapskates, AA50k, Mt. Taylor).



July 26th

I got hydrostatically weighed again

Test Date Body  Fat Weigh Fat Free Weight Body Fat Method
          Weight (lbs)        (lbs)          %
7/26/2018 151.4   14.7        136.7         9.74   Hydrostaic weighing

I actually gained .4 pounds of Fat Free Weight, meaning I gained muscle
while I burned fat.

So, to get to 7.3% BF, I need to get to 147.5 pounds.  Since our scale
registers 2.25 pounds high, I need to get to 149.75 pounds.  This morning
I was at 153.75, so I need to lose 4 pounds, which I should be able to
do in about a month, although with BARGE and Leadville coming up, it may
be a little tricky.


November 9th

I got hydrostatically weighed yesterday

Test Date Body  Fat Weigh Fat Free Weight Body Fat Method
          Weight (lbs)        (lbs)          %
11/8/2018 152.6   14.0        138.6         9.15   Hydrostaic weighing

So, to get to 7.3% BF, I need to get to 149.5 pounds. However, since I
was weighed in the afternoon, on a Thursday, after I had normal post-run
breakfast and a vegan burrito at Cocoa Conspiracy, the difference between
my starting weight yesterday and my weight at UNM was 1.3 pounds, so if I
want to register 7.3% BF @ UNM on a similar Thursday, I'll need to be
148.2 in the morning.  However, I never really said what time of day my
%BF should be 7.3, so arguably 149.5 in the morning should be sufficient,
although since a bunch of the difference between morning weight and afternoon
weight is due to what I've eaten and I don't know how that affects density,
the only way to be sure that a morning weight of 149.9 would correspond to 7.3
would be to test it.

I think I'll simply try to keep my weight around 148 in the morning during
the first few weeks of my training for BMDM.  Once it's been there for
a while I'll go ahead and see if that gets me a 7.3.

TODO: double check the numbers and logic in my November 9th entry, because
it seems like I'm way too close to 7.3, considering how little the needle
moved between 7/26 and 11/8.


November 22nd (Thanksgiving)

Since I'm now doing three pack runs a week and am badk to core exercises,
I actually expect to gain muscle (especially since I gained muscle the
last two periods before hydrodtatic weighing). If I gain .54 pounds more
muscle between now and my next hydrostatic weighing, I will only need to
be 150.1, so that is my new goal.

I actually hit that weight most recently on Monday, November 19th and
have hit it a total of 4 times since my most recent hydrostatic weighing
(but of course the closer to the weighing the less muscle I will have
added).

Monday 20181119 Starting weight 151.50 / 150.1 48 bpm, 23.9F (Heritage Hills)
Wednesday 20181114 Starting weight 152.00 / 150.1 47 bpm, 22.5F (Heritage Hills)
Saturday 20181110 Starting weight 151.50 / 150.1 47 bpm, 28.6F (Alameda & River)
Friday 20181109 Starting weight 151.50 / 149.9 47 bpm, 23.7F

So, assuming I can not go overboard today (Thanksgiving) or tomorrow
(Black Friday Turkey Trots) or Saturday (Bosque Boogie), I will probabaly
get to 150.1 again fairly soon and hit it occasionally.
