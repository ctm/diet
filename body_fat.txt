I lost my body fat page!

My recollection is that I was about 24%.  To err on the side of conservancy,
I'll say I was 23% even and that I weight 185.  If so, that means I had
44.55 % body fat and 142.45 is my non-fat weight.

I'd like to get to 12.9%

So, (100 - 12.9) / 100 * ideal_body_weight = 142.45
87.1 / 100 * ideal_body_weight = 142.45
ideal_body_weight = 142.45 * 100 / 87.1

That brings me to 163.54 pounds ... I'm skeptical that I should weigh
so little.  If my bf% was incorrect or if I've botched the reasoning
or math, that could be bad.  However, to get to 163.54, I need to go
through higher weights first, so let's plan on getting to 173.5 first
and see how my performance behaves as I get there, since that's about
what I'll get to as I go into my taper for Cruel Jewel.

April 18th, 2018

I've already dropped to 175 without any performance loss.  Assuming I
lost purely body fat (and I don't know how safe that assumption is), in
theory I'm now at 18.6% BF.  However, because I didn't actually
cross-calibrate my scale to the scale(s) they use at UNM, I could be off
by a few pounds.  As such, it probably makes sense to get my BF tested
again shortly after Cruel Jewel, both to see how much lean body mass I
lost (or gained!) as well as to cross-calibrate the scales.


May 10th, 2018

Found my body fat page.

I'm down to 167.5 pounds without any apparent performance loss.  Mark W.
and I would have gotten six ascents except there was a crime scene at
the turn off Tramway toward LLTH and we wound up helping out and being
detained for too long to make it worthwhile.  I ran the Run for the Zoo
1/2 marathon the following day (after doing 5 ascents) and got it done
in 1:55:49 and that included two porta potty stops and the slowdowns
associated with GI distress.

Anyway, my BF page says:

Body Weight: 185.5
Fat Weight 40.7
Fat Free Weight 144.8

BC Method: Hydrostatic weighing
Equation: Male Heward Compile

Body Density 1.04883 g/cc
RV: 2.075 L

Body Fat %: 21.95

So, my body weight for 12.9% would be 144.8 * 100 / 87.1 = 166.0
Seeing how I'm 167.5 and doing well, I'm thinking it would be better
to take myself down to 7.3%, which would be: 156.  That seems extreme
but is really just a BMI of 20, so I'll probably press onward.  At my
rate of weight loss for the last 30 days, that would require another
28 days of dieting, but I imagine that I'll pause my weight loss
during Cruel Jewel and may even regain some weight if I'm not careful
and that as I approach that weight I'll wind up losing more slowly, so
realistically I don't think I'll be able to get down to 156 until
early August, at earliest.  However, at 156, that means I can run
with a 30 pound pack at about the same weight I was running before
I lost my weight!


June 4th BF page, 2018

Body Weight: 159.6
Fat Weight: 23.3
Fat Free Weight: 136.3

Body Density: 1.06541 g/cc
RV: 2.070 (used to be 2.075?)

Body Fat % 14.61

Since March 29th:
67 days
25.9 pounds lost
2.70 pounds per week lost

If I were to not lose any muscle, going to 147 (i.e. losing 12.6 more
pounds) would take me to 7.3%.  However, I'll probably lose some more
muscle, so I probably need to lose more than 12.6, so going for 145 is
probably more realistic.

Our scale weighs 2.2 pounds high.  It had me at 162 when the scale at UNM
had me at 159.8.  NOTE: my weight above is listed as 159.6 because I took
a leak after weighing myself at 159.8 and after that leak I weighed 159.6.

June 13th, 2018

Just adding the 2.2 to 145 to show that my target is 147.25 *ON OUR SCALE*
meaning I have 12.5 more pounds to lose, which would be about six weeks

July 2nd, 2018

Haven't weighed as little as I did on June 13th, but might tomorrow
morning, depending on how big my poop is.  So, still about six weeks
out, but Baldy 50k may interfere w/ weight loss as well as any
tapering I do before Leadville and Leadville itself.  May be harder to
hit my goal by Tahoe 200 than I was thinking a month ago.

July 6th, 2018

Tied my low weight of 158.5, but I don't think it's an anomaly.  I suspect
I'll be < 159 tomorrow, too, whereas I bounced from 158.5 to 161 overnight
between the 10th and 11th.  Today was my fastest circa 130 BPM 13.1 mile
non-pack run (2:02:17, 131bpm).

July 16th new low of 157.25.  Taco Tuesday coming up, so that may be a
complication, but overall I think I'm dialing in losing weight while
eating more protein.

In theory I want to lose exactly ten pounds before I get
hydrostatically tested again, however that's going to take me past
BARGE and *probably* past Tahoe 200, both of which are likely to
interrupt my weight loss and cause even further delays.  It also means
I'll either still be trying to lose or only have stabilized recently
by the time my races start to pick up in September (Wounded Warrior
half, Tour de Cheapskates, AA50k, Mt. Taylor).

July 26th, 2018

I got hydrostatically weighed again

Test Date Body Fat Weight Fat Free Weight Body Fat Method
          Weight (lbs)        (lbs)          %
7/26/2018 151.4   14.7        136.7         9.74   Hydrostaic weighing

I actually gained .4 pounds of Fat Free Weight, meaning I gained muscle
while I burned fat.

So, to get to 7.3% BF, I need to get to 147.5 pounds.  Since our scale
registers 2.25 pounds high, I need to get to 149.75 pounds.  This morning
I was at 153.75, so I need to lose 4 pounds, which I should be able to
do in about a month, although with BARGE and Leadville coming up, it may
be a little tricky.


November 9th, 2018

I got hydrostatically weighed yesterday

Test Date Body Fat Weight Fat Free Weight Body Fat Method
          Weight (lbs)        (lbs)          %
11/8/2018 152.6   14.0        138.6         9.15   Hydrostatic weighing

So, to get to 7.3% BF, I need to get to 149.5 pounds. However, since I
was weighed in the afternoon, on a Thursday, after I had normal post-run
breakfast and a vegan burrito at Cocoa Conspiracy, the difference between
my starting weight yesterday and my weight at UNM was 1.3 pounds, so if I
want to register 7.3% BF @ UNM on a similar Thursday, I'll need to be
148.2 in the morning.  However, I never really said what time of day my
%BF should be 7.3, so arguably 149.5 in the morning should be sufficient,
although since a bunch of the difference between morning weight and afternoon
weight is due to what I've eaten and I don't know how that affects density,
the only way to be sure that a morning weight of 149.9 would correspond to 7.3
would be to test it.

I think I'll simply try to keep my weight around 148 in the morning during
the first few weeks of my training for BMDM.  Once it's been there for
a while I'll go ahead and see if that gets me a 7.3.

TODO: double check the numbers and logic in my November 9th entry, because
it seems like I'm way too close to 7.3, considering how little the needle
moved between 7/26 and 11/8.


November 22nd (Thanksgiving)

Since I'm now doing three pack runs a week and am back to core exercises,
I actually expect to gain muscle (especially since I gained muscle the
last two periods before hydrostatic weighing). If I gain .54 pounds more
muscle between now and my next hydrostatic weighing, I will only need to
be 150.1, so that is my new goal.

I actually hit that weight most recently on Monday, November 19th and
have hit it a total of 4 times since my most recent hydrostatic weighing
(but of course the closer to the weighing the less muscle I will have
added).

Monday 20181119 Starting weight 151.50 / 150.1 48 bpm, 23.9F (Heritage Hills)
Wednesday 20181114 Starting weight 152.00 / 150.1 47 bpm, 22.5F (Heritage Hills)
Saturday 20181110 Starting weight 151.50 / 150.1 47 bpm, 28.6F (Alameda & River)
Friday 20181109 Starting weight 151.50 / 149.9 47 bpm, 23.7F

So, assuming I can not go overboard today (Thanksgiving) or tomorrow
(Black Friday Turkey Trots) or Saturday (Bosque Boogie), I will probably
get to 150.1 again fairly soon and hit it occasionally.

August 25th, 2022, nearly four years since my last one

Test Date Body Fat Weight Fat Free Weight Body Fat Method
          Weight (lbs)        (lbs)          %
8/25/2022 148.9   13.4        135.5         8.98   Hydrostaic weighing

So, according to this, my fat free weight was 3.1 pounds lighter than
my fat free weight on November 8th, 2018, which is both the most
recent time I've been hydrostatically weighed and also my previous
lowest percentage body fat (9.15%).  In theory, I've lost 3.1 pounds
of muscle, but back my core exercises were:

10, 15, 20 SU
10, 15, 20 PU
45 SQ

and today my core exercises were

100 SU
100 "dynamic planks"
100 SQ
38, 28, 30, 24, 20, 20, 20, 23, 10 PU

and I believe my upper body looks like it has more muscle than it used
to back in 2018 (although my memory is notoriously poor).  On the
other hand, I haven't done a lot of consistent training and relatively
little with my pack over the last few months, so there's a chance that
I've gained muscle up top and lost even more in my legs, but there's
also a big testing difference in that I fasted since yesterday early
evening this time, whereas on 11/8/2018 I had normal oatmeal at 7:15,
a vegan burrito and a quad soy decaff cappuccino at 9:00.  So *my
guess* is that some of that food was counted as fat free weight.

From my 2018.txt:

Thursday 20181108 Starting weight 153.00 / 151.3 48 bpm, 34.7F

From 2022.txt:

Thursday 20220825 weight 152.1 65.5F 78% humidity @ 7:21 (Sevano Circle)

In 2018 I was using two scales, the first number, 153.00, is what I weighed
on our old balance and the second number, 151.3, is what I weighed on our
electronic scale.  The electronic scale was a better value (and eventually I
got rid of the balance).

So in in 2018, I weighed 151.3 in the morning, but 152.6 by the time I
was hydrostatically weighed.  This morning I weighed 152.1, but was
down to 148.9 by the time I was hydrostatically weighed.

Bottom line is that I wouldn't mind gaining some more muscle, but I don't
think I lost as much as it appears.

I have to concentrate on getting Craft Poker Co. up and running, so I
have to do something to battle my post-lunch sleepiness.  It seems to
be worst after I have my popcorn at 2pm, so although that's been
helping keep me losing weight, I think shifting to 300 calories of
nuts may be a better (but more expensive) choice.

I think I also need to cut back on the beer, although I'll be doing
some celebratory drinking due to Creede.

September 29th, 2022, five weeks after my previous test

Test Date Body Fat Weight Fat Free Weight Body Fat Method
          Weight (lbs)        (lbs)          %
9/29/2022 148.7   13.8        134.9         9.30   Hydrostaic weighing

This one was surprising, because at 5:46 this morning I weighed 149.8,
but at 5:52 on August 25th (when I was last hydrostatically weighed), I
weighed 152.1.  In both cases I ran/walked 15.5 miles after finishing
my core.  So, in theory, I lost .6 pounds of muscle in the last five
weeks.  I *guess* that's possible, since I backslid in some respect on
my push-ups (my first three sets were 38, 28, 30 five weeks ago and
today they were 35, 25, 27, *BUT* I did more set for a total of 268
push-ups today and only 213 five weeks ago).

Some of my push-up loss was after pacing Jason at the Creede 100.  My
eating there was definitely poor.  I ate a ton of junk food waiting
for Jason to arrive, then had no calories (although I did have a couple
beers) for many miles.  I drank a bit back in Jason's trailer after he
finished and the day after I ate like a piggy.  Additionally, I skipped
push-ups entirely on the 13th, 15th, an 20th due to my truck problems
up in Utah.  I've also mostly been in taper / recovery after running
the Big Cottonwood Marathon fairly heavily.

So, I guess the next time to get hydrostatically weighed would be
Thursday, November 3rd, after the Javelina Jundred and before Deadman
Peaks Trail Run.  I don't think I'm going to wait until that one
before I start doing at least some of my trainings with a little food
in me.
