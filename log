Saturday 20180331

533 normal oatmeal:
    160  1/3 cup coaches oats
    113 2 tablespoons nutriva hemp
    120 2 tablespoons nutriva black chia
     80 silk soy milk
     60 1/2 tablespoon udos oil

322 large avocado

400 2x 200 calories tailwind

100 roctane gu

??? 2 large bowls of bean soup with rice

322 1 large avocado

 50 1 large orange

 50 1 medium orange

120 1 banana

 15 3 greek olives

 ?? green drink

  3 10 small pickles

1593 + whatever the bowls of bean soup with rice + green drink + rice milk

I also wasn't logging throughout the day and I may have forgotten something.
In theory I burned 3495 calories in 7 hours, 21 minutes and then there's
also my base calorie burn (1,734 calories / day)

If I calculated right, I burned 1,734 + 3495 - (7:21 / 24:00 * 1734) calories
or 4,698 calories today.  If so, then I'm probably running at least a 1,000
calorie deficit which is appropriate for 2 pounds / week.

Hmmm... a different base metabolic calculator figures I need 3,367.42 calories
to keep my typical activity level going without any weight change, but that
probably takes some of the 3,495 into consideration

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunday 20180401

Rode my bike 50 miles before having any calories.  I didn't write down
when I had eaten last, but my guess is I had an avocado yesterday evening
at about 7pm.  I started riding my bike about 7am and didn't finish until
a little before 10am

??? Had a green drink sometime

533 normal oatmeal (at about 10am):
    160  1/3 cup coaches oats
    113 2 tablespoons nutriva hemp
    120 2 tablespoons nutriva black chia
     80 silk soy mil
     60 1/2 tablespoon udos oil

Did I have rice milk?  I didn't write it down, but a week later I'm
suspecting I did, because I typically have rice milk after my bike
ride.  OTOH, we may have been out that day.

Lunch 12:06pm
400? bowl of bean soup with rice (not much rice) -- guessing at type and amount
300? 2nd bowl of bean soup without rice          -- of beans
480 handful of nuts (3 oz) -- In the future, I should probably only have
                              1 to 1.5 oz of nuts at a time
60? bowl of steamed cauliflower
120 medium banana (final lunch food @ 1:21pm)

Snack 3:30pm
200? handful of dates -- 23 calories per date, did I have 9?
120 medium banana
 50 small orange
 50 large orange

Dinner 5:32pm
444? bowl of quinoa -- 222 calories per cup, did I have 2 cups?
240 half brick of tempeh

Snack 6:20pm
480 handful of nuts -- I took these w/o thinking.  I probably should have
                       eaten something else, but I'm in the habit of eating
                       handfuls of nuts

Looks like all told I ate about 2,944 calories

1,734 + 1615 - (1,734 / 8) = 3,132 calories
If all of the above is correct, I probably *didn't* get a 1,000 calorie
deficit in part due to all the nuts.  OTOH, I'm not sure that I'm supposed
to subtract the BMR portion of the day

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monday 20180402 Starting weight 184

Back from my 13.1 mile run, 9:15am
600 normal oatmeal

Lunch 11:35

Snack 1:20pm
40 6x small sweet pickles

snack 5:11
120 medium banana

snack 6:34
240 half brick of tempeh
 50 small orange
 50 large orange
 50? salad

TOTAL: approx. 2925

2915 calories burned 1,734 + 1352 - (1,734 * 142 / 1440)

However, I also did push-ups and sit-ups along the way

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday 20180403 Starting weight 183.5

Back from my 6.55 mile run, 7:45am

533 normal oatmeal
 50? glass of rice milk
 50? green drink

Lunch 11:42
 66 2 cups green beans
300 2x vegan tamales

Snack 2:28 pm
120 medium banana

Dinner 4:30
250 cup of refried beans (Taco Shel)
250 cup of rice (Taco Shel)

Taco Tuesday beer 6:30
285? 8 oz. 13.75% ABV
167? 10 oz. 6.5% ABV

Salad 8:53
50?  small salad (no dressing)
50?  cucumber salad (I'll have to ask Sophie what was in it)
40 6x small sweet pickles

TOTAL: approx. 2,620
2381 calories burned 1,734 + 733 - (1,734 * 71 / 1440)

May not have run a deficit, but considering I had the equivalent of three
beers (over two hours) and came home and ate *something*, I don't appear
to have *gained* any weight and I feel pretty good the morning after (and
am looking forward to some speed work)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wednesday 20180404 Starting weight 183.5

I already know in advance that my snack is coming from the ARR free food
at 7pm, so I need to time things accordingly

Back from my 13.1 mile run (with intervals), 9:30am

488 normal oatmeal:
    160  1/3 cup coaches oats
    113 2 tablespoons nutriva hemp
    120 2 tablespoons nutriva black chia
     35 silk almond / coconut milk
     60 1/2 tablespoon udos oil

 50? glass of rice milk
 50? green drink
120 quarter brick of tempeh

Lunch 12:13
700? Yellow lentils that Sophie doctored up with chickpeas, spinach and red
     pepper.  The good thing is no oil was added, however, it's less protein
     dense and I really have no idea how many calories are in it.

     I'll add a salad and some pineapple and then plan on eating more
     tempeh for my snack, since today I ran 13.1 and I'm doing core

 75 cup of pineapple (raw, not in syrup) probably less than a cup
 50 small salad (darker greens than previous)

Snack ?2:47? -- forgot to write down the time
120 quarter brick of tempeh

dinner at 5pm
700? other bowl of doctored yellow lentils
 60? bowl of steamed cauliflower & broccoli
 50 small orange
 50 large orange
120 6 dates

snack 7pm ARR meeting
??? 2 pieces of broccoli with guacamole

Didn't try summing the calories from yesterday or estimating the
deficit, but I lost 1.5 pounds (see below).  Some of that may just be
due to random fluctuations with how much I pooped in the morning (a
lot!), but overall I think my estimates are so loose that it's not
worth the time for me to sum them up and estimate my deficit, *as long
as I carefully restrict myself and keep watching the numbers*.

Wednesday 20180418 Starting weight 175 (expect no loss or gain tomorrow)

I didn't plan on having three pints yesterday, but one of the Team RWB
members forgot that he was having surgery the next day and ordered a
Stella and then realized he couldn't drink it, so I had it, then I
ordered a stout, liked it and had another one.  I didn't eat after
coming home, nor did I drink anything.  As such, I may be partially
dehydrated, although it was also chilly last night--we left the
windows open--and perhaps my body burned even more fat than normal to
keep warm, although I did grab my sleeping bag around 3am.

Thursday 20180419 Starting weight 175.25

My quarter pound weight gain is not too surprising, since I had lost
two pounds in the prior day.  The two pound loss was probably
partially due to me having had three beers and no water as my last
thing consumed the evening prior, so yesterday morning's weight was
probably lower than normal due to lack of water.  I think my diet
yesterday was fine considering it was both a 13.1 w/intervals and a
core exercise day.

This was the Cedro Peak 50k.  I skipped breakfast and accidentally didn't
eat my avocado, because I never touched my Cedro Peak drop bag.  I had
prepared two avocados.  I should have eaten a bunch more at the aid

Thursday 20180426 Starting weight 171.5
I may have overcompensated for the beer by eating too lightly yesterday or
it could just be whatever source of randomness in weight fluctation just
happened to favor me today.

8.9 mile 31.5# pack run
First post-BMDM pack run.  Used my SAR pack w/o some standard stuff, 'cause
that's how it was packed and I didn't think it was too important to have 40#
seeing how my right ankle is still slightly swollen.  This is just to get
back into the swing of things (and also give me a little more exercise than
a normal Thursday, since I won't get my full exercise up at Philmont on
Saturday and might not get my full exercise on Sunday, either).

Breakfast @ 8:15 (roughly; forgot to write it down)
533  normal oatmeal (after 8.9 mile run)
 50? 16 oz. rice milk
 50? green drink

9:45 snack
120 1/2 brick tempeh

Noon lunch
460? 2 cups brown lentils
 70 1 1/2 cups green beans
 40? 1/2 cup peas 
 50 small salad
120 1/2 brick tempeh

3:15 snack
20? small amount of peas & green beans left over from lunch
160 1 oz mixed unsalted nuts
130  medium banana

4:00 snack
 60 4 oz. pineapple (because it was there)

5:00 dinner
155? 2/3 cups brown lentils
500? more, but different lentils & matpe beans
300? avocado

6:00 beer
335? Petrus 16 oz. 8.5% ABV

NOTE: Friday, Saturday and Sunday are all even more inaccurate than
      normal due to me driving to and attending ESCAPE.  That
      prevented me from weighing myself at my normal time on Friday
      and at all on Saturday or Sunday (actually, I weighed myself
      when I got back on Sunday, but that was about 3:10pm, so I
      didn't record it).  ESCAPE had a nice menu for vegetarians and a
      fairly decent salad bar for vegans, but they didn't really
      appear to have many (any?) protein sources for vegans, so I ate
      seitan, tempeh and 2 dehydrated meals.  I also didn't exercise
      as much as normal, although I did do two 32# (estimated) pack
      runs.

      When I got back from ESCAPE, I had an Avery Beast Grand Cru and
      I think the bottle said it was 17.4% ABV (the ABV varies per year).
      That not only added a bunch of calories, but it also reduced my
      willpower and I ate some dates that I probably didn't need to
      eat (they were in a baggie; I took them "just in case").  I may
      have also eaten stuff I didn't write down.

      I suspect I didn't lose any weight at ESCAPE and I won't be too
      surprised (although I'll be disappointed) if I gained weight.

Monday 20180430 Starting weight 172.5

I gained a pound over the ESCAPE weekend instead of continuing with my
weight loss.  I suspected that would happen.  Oh well.  If I hadn't
had the beer when I got back I probably wouldn't have gained as much,
but I did eat well and got in some good (although a tiny amount) of
exercise while I was up at Philmont.

Breakfast @ 9:00

~130g protein.  I probably didn't need to eat the tempeh to get the
101 grams of protein _Racing Weight_ claims a vegan athlete of my
weight needs, however today was both 13.1 miles *with* intervals and
core exercise (100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups and 60 squats), so perhaps
having some extra isn't too bad.

Wednesday 20180502 Starting weight 170

Not too surprising that I didn't lose weight after a seemingly 2.5
pound loss the previous day.  However, I didn't gain any, even though
I had around 800 calories of beer last night.

Breakfast @ 9:00
533  normal oatmeal (after 13.1 mile run)

160  1 oz. mixed nuts

7pm Snack
150 pretzel with hummus
 30 5x pringles

Thursday 20180503 Starting weight 171

Should have skipped the tamales since they were largely empty
calories.  Should have had less pineapple and strawberries, since
they're high in sugar. Should have skipped the 7pm snack, although
normally they have veggies.  Taking a step backward is annoying,
especially since I didn't feel particularly hungry much of yesterday,
so my eating was based more on "I can do this within my calorie count"
rather than "I need to eat something because my hunger is distracting"

8:00 Breakfast

     Sophie had already mixed the rice and beans.  It was about a 1 1/4 cup.
     There was maybe 3/4 cup  of steamed broccoli, squash and zucchini.
     I was hungry, so I threw the remaining veggies and topped it off with
     black beans and added a lot of the black bean broth.  I don't have a
     good feel for how many calories were in it, but I normally eat at 5
     and was exceedingly hungry.

150? 3/4 cup remaining black beans
240  3x cara cara orange

Saturday 20180505 Starting weight unknown

Elevation Insanity

We started hiking at 12:00:01 am.  I did not have any food after
dinner and before I got to the truck after the first ascent, which was
approximately 4:45am.  That's when I had my first caffeine.  I did not
write down what I ate and when, but I know that I consumed roughly the
following.  I brought "emergency" gels and Tailwind but never used
them.

We only made 5 ascents, but we were on our feet pretty much from the
start until approx. 8pm (20 hours), although we got a little time to
sit waiting for the tram and driving to trailheads.  We were actually
doing hikes for 15:51:24 and went approximately 33.83 miles, climbing
approximately 20,698 ft.

Sunday 20180506 Starting weight unknown (was in hurry to get to the zoo)

Run for the Zoo half marathon

I got up at my regular 5:15 and decided to see if I could get to the
zoo early enough to register for RftZ 1/2.  I didn't have any food
before.  Afterward I wound up eating leftover food from Elevation
Insanity, including the following.  I did not keep track of when I ate
or *exactly* what I ate (especially the dates and nuts).  I don't
think I ate anything but the popsicles, keva juice and beer other than
Elevation Insanity leftovers until dinner.

4 popsicles
3 tiny platic cups of keva juice

800 1.5 baggies of fortified oatmeal

Tuesday 20180508 Starting weight 168.0

No loss and maybe a tiny gain, but that's not too surprising after
such a big loss, especially with eating the mystery calorie pizza and
only running half my normal Monday distance.  The next two weeks will
be tricky since I'm on my taper.

Wednesday 20180509 Starting weight 167.8

Not quite down to 167.75, but definitely a little under 168.0.
Tonight is RubiABQ, so that may make further losses difficult.  OTOH,
this morning is a 36# pack run, so we'll see.  My pack is only 36
pounds because I'm using my SAR pack (w/o the water bladder) exactly
as it is currently configured.  I'll resume training with my Kelty
pack after I get it kitted up with food (or weights!).

7:15 Breakfast
533  normal oatmeal (after 5.55 mile 36.5# pack run)

FORGOT TO WRITE DOWN BEER CONSUMED

Thursday 20180510 Starting weight 167.5

1:00 Breakfast after running 4.45 mi
Breakfast was late because we had a SAR mission that had us drive up north
of Santa Fe, then turn around.  I chose not to eat anything before going on
my taper 4.45 mile run.

533  normal oatmeal (after 5.55 mile 36.5# pack run)

460 2 cups brown lentils
360 3x medium banana
120 6 dates

Friday 20180511 Starting weight 167.75

Beer with food was probably what did me in.  That SAR mission certainly
threw off my schedule.  There's a chance that by eating so late my weight
is up simply because not everything I ate yesterday has passed through me,
but for now I'll simply assume I had too many calories, especially since I
am on my taper.  Speaking of which, today I start my 1/4 distance taper,
so I need even fewer calories...

7:00 Breakfast (after 3.22 mile run: 1/4 distance taper)

Monday 20180514 Starting weight 166.5
FWIW, my plan is to not drop any more weight between now and Thursday morning,
which will be the last day I have access to our home scales before I get back
on Monday.  I am not going to fret if I lose a little or even gain a little
during this time or after Cruel Jewel.  I'm going to wait until after I feel
stable after CJ100 before I resume losing.

650? normal oatmeal (after 4 mile run with 3x 75 second all-out intervals)
     I had made some oatmeal prior to a SAR mission and it was in the fridge.
     I started eating it, but it had a bit of a sour taste.  Eventually I
     threw what was remaining out and made a new bowl, but as I was pouring
     on the soy milk, it was all bubbly and smelled funny.  I tried a forkful
     or two and it was sour, so I threw that out and made another bowl, this
     time with Sophie's almond & coconut (still unsweetened) milk.  So that
     third bowl was less than 533 calories (because the almond and coconut
     milk has less calories than the soy), but I don't know how much I ate
     of the other bowls, which is why I have 650 with a question mark.
 50? 16 oz. rice milk

Tuesday 20180515 Starting weight 167.75

Wow. I was just trying not to lose any weight and I went overboard and
gained a pound and a quarter.  Oh well.  Live and learn.  Part of that
is that I only ran 4 miles yesterday rather than my usual Monday 13.1.
That's roughly a 900 calorie change right there.

Looks like the refrigerator probaby was left open overnight, because
three packages of seitan with a "Best Used Before June 19th" label are
all puffed up.  *Perhaps* that's why I got so bloated last night (and
am still bloated); I had attributed it to the 8 cups of beans I had.

8:15 am (Mountain time) huge snack
Because we had to change planes, I got concerned with my lack of calories, so
I took out a huge bag of nuts and ate about half of them.  I never weighed
the bags, so even if I ate exactly half (and I didn't even try to measure
that), I still wouldn't know how much I ate.

my avocados (I took two), pickles and often a handful of skittles and
a stack of Lays version of Pringles.  One aid station had hummus, which
I ate on mini prezels, oh yeah, I ate mini pretzels elsehwere.  I drank
coke starting about 8pm.  I had coffee sometime.

Saturday 20180519 Starting weight unknown

On the course, ate a bunch of oranges, watermelon, bananas, my second
avocado (I took two), pickles and often a handful of skittles and
a stack of Lays version of Pringles.  One aid station had hummus avocado
pinwheels (i.e. wrapped in a flour tortilla).  I ate all they had (they
said they could make more, so I wasn't shorting anyone else).

Hadn't planned on losing weight while I still have this cold, however I
don't think I understand the weight gain and loss associated with CJ100.
I'm not unhappy that I'm back down again.  I'm just surprised.  I still
have enough of a cold that I won't be drinking any beer today, even though
it's Thursday.

Not surprising that I gained weight with all that eating yesterday.
However, I got rid of the nut butter and the extra food may have helped me
recover quicker from the Crest Trail hike, although since I had the leak
in my 2.5 gallon water brick, that wasn't as taxing as it could have been.

drink beer that often...

I was pretty quick on this morning's run.

morning's run and set a PR for 13.1 miles @ 130bpm: 2:15:47 (10:21 min/mile)
although that could have been due to my pre-workout and during workout

Saturday 20180609 Starting weight 165

Due to pigging out yesterday I was overweight, but in theory that would give
me plenty of energy during the Chimney Melon 50k. In reality I wound up with
some cramps that seemed to keep me walking even after I escaped the heat in
the second half of the second loop.

I did not write down what I ate until two days later, but it was
something like:

5:15 breakfast
533 normal oatmeal (25g protein)

during loop 1
3 tablespoons of chia (in water) before the tram
a bunch of mixed nuts
3 tablespoons of chia (in water) after the tram
more mixed nuts

at the truck
one large avocado
24 oz. rice milk
more nuts

during loop 2
3 tablespoons of chia (in water) before the tram
a bunch of mixed nuts
3 tablespoons of chia (in water) after the tram
more mixed nuts

at the truck again
16 oz. rice milk

back at the house
533 normal oatmeal (25g protein)

FWIW, I had made two containers of oatmeal, but forgot to put them in
the cooler, so I wasn't able to eat oatmeal at the truck between loops
1 and 2.

Sunday 20180610 Starting weight 158.5

I got called to a search and rescue mission, so that interfered with my
food logging.

I got called right before I left to go biking.

At the incident base I had a bunch of nuts and eventually my fortified
oatmeal

When I got back, noon was approaching and I had 3 tablespoons of chia
in my water while I did my core exercises

After my core exercises I had (although some of this may have been after lunch)
12 oz. Avery Beast
12 oz. Rochefort 10

Lunch was watery beans, a ton of broccoli, a small salad and maybe more

my dinner was very watery beans with some quinoa and maybe more

I ate at least three oranges after Sophie came back from Costco:
at least one soon after she came back and two right after dinner

Monday 20180611 Starting weight 161

So, I lost 1.75 pounds in the last week and definitely had more chia
while exercising.  Does the smaller weight loss and the increased
protein from chia mean that my loss was a higher percentage of fat
than previously?  I won't know for another five or more weeks, and we
have the family trip between now and then, so it'll still be hard to
tell, but I think it's a good start.

I should have kept track of what I ate during yesterday.  One thing
that I might want to do is pre-package a bunch of 1 oz. mixed nuts
since sandwich baggies are so light.

Not surprising I gained weight, especially with the four slices of
pizza, although they were small.  OTOH, my glycogen stores are
probably much higher than most mornings, so I expect to do well in my
morning run.

After coming back from my run I weighed 157.5.  I ran 8.9 miles at a
9:41 min/mi pace @ 134bpm.  The temp was 77F when I got back.

Surprising gain, seeing how I thought I ate basically what I ate a week
prior.  I'm guessing I underestimated the calorie content of the northern
beans.  There were also some veggies thrown in and perhaps other stuff.
My portions were also on the big side of things.

Today will be tricky, since it's Taco Tuesday.  OTOH, since I only run
8.9 miles and I'm not doing core, I don't need to eat much between now
and then.
