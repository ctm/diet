To anyone other than myself (or perhaps even to myself if I get even
more forgetful): this file is primarily intended for my own use.  As
such, there may be unstated pieces of information that could be useful
to anyone else.  Off the top of my head, here are a few things that
perhaps I should mention:

  I take a daily B-complex supplement, specifically Jarrow Formula's B-Right

  I used to take a daily multivitamin (that may not be vegan), specifically
  Kirkland's Signature Daily Multi, but stopped when the huge bottle ran
  out, sometime in early 2019, I believe.  On Friday, December 4th, 2020
  I started taking them again.  I'm not convinced they help, but I think
  there's a better chance that they help then that they hurt.

  I have a double espresso or more, pretty much at 5:15am every
  morning.  I make it the day before and if I get up before 5:15, I
  don't drink it until my 5:15 alarm goes off.  If I am awakened by my
  alarm, I grab it off my dresser and drink it.

  I drink water when I feel like it, which isn't very often when I'm
  not actually running.  I didn't record the water I drink but I did
  record everything else (other than my 5:15am double espresso, which
  I initially didn't log, but do now).  I now mostly record my water
  consumption, although most of my water comes from the food I eat
  since I typically prepare lentils and/or beans in two or three cups
  of water.

  Over time exactly what I've written down has changed slightly, in that
  now I'm logging my starting weight, which is how much I weigh after I've
  had my morning double espresso, pooped but before I've eaten anything or
  exercised.  I also log the nearby temperature and my resting heart rate.

  I typically exercise before I eat any calories, although I make an exception
  on Wednesdays (when I'm doing a pack run) and Saturdays when I do my "long"
  run.  I typically record how much I've run before I eat, but the general
  pattern from mid November through mid March is:

    Monday 13.1 miles (with interval work mixed in)
    Tuesday 8.9 miles
    Wednesday some distance (with a 40# pack)
    Thursday 8.9 miles
    Friday 13.1 miles
    Saturday either long flat pack run or 5 miles up the mountain and back
             down again with a pack
    Sunday bike ride, typically 35.5 miles, but more if Saturday was light
                      unless it's cold enough for there to be ice or I'm
                      exercising with Team RWB.  So, I really don't ride
                      my bike much during these months

  I have extensive stats on my exercising that are not part of this file

  I do core exercises twice a week, which consists of at least
  100 sit-ups, at least 100 push-ups and 100 unweighted squats.  I
  break the sit-ups and push-ups into currently two sets, and am
  slowly increasing the number in the first two sets with the idea of
  eventually getting to 2 sets of 50, then possibly moving to a longer
  set followed by a shorter set.  Over the years I tend to build up my
  core to where I'm doing > 50 sit-ups in the first set and > 50
  push-ups in the first set, but then something causes me to slack off
  and I have to drop way back.  My body really doesn't want to keep
  much non-leg muscle on, unless I'm consistent.
    
As far as I can tell, I'm the healthiest of the five of us in my
nuclear family (the other four being my wife, my son (born in 2002)
and my twin daughters (born in 2004).  I base that on my perception of
how often we get sick, who gets sick first and how long people remain
sick, but I do not have objective measurements of any of that.  I do
appear to be pretty healthy though.

My goal had been to get my body fat percentage down to 7.3%.  I had my
third hydrostatic weighing on Thursday, July 26th, 2018.  That gave me
an idea of how much more I needed to lose.  I had been monitoring my
performance in my daily runs to make sure my weight loss is not
interfering with my performance.  My weight loss *was* interfering with
my ability to get stuff done from about 6pm to 8pm.  I mostly lost
motivation then.  I expect my motivation to return when I'm no longer
stressing my body by running a calorie deficit.

The above paragraph doesn't really say much about what happened
between mid 2018 and now (December 9th, 2020), but it's been
interesting and informative.  I typically play a poker tournament at
6:05 Mountain time and if I'm cutting weight my body prioritizes my
morning and evening and slows down significantly in between which is
not optimal for writing code.  Luckily, I'm not currently cutting
weight, but when I hit that cylcle in my training again I'll have to
watch how it affects my work.  Most likely I'll have to forego the
daily poker tournament.

Initially I was going to try to calculate my calorie intake and my calorie
expenditure, but I decided that it's better to simply estimate my calorie
intake and compare similar days to previous similar days and try to do what
has worked before or make adjustments to what hasn't worked.

FWIW, when I started doing this I thought it would be hard to lose
weight because so many people have trouble with it.  It was easy for
me to lose weight, although perhaps I lost too much muscle in the
early days.  Since I haven't yet had my third hydrostatic weighing I
don't know for sure that I've increased the percentage of my weight loss
which was fat burned, but I think I have.  I'll know soon.

I wrote this preamble on Tuesday, July 24th, 2018, long after I
started this log, although I've tweaked it slightly on Monday, June
3rd, 2019.  I recently updated it on December 9th, 2020, but I did so
very quickly and there's not guarantee it's particularly accurate.

I mention products by name, just to be more specific.  I do not have
any sponsorships or any other form of compensation from anyone or any
entity.  Much of the food I eat comes from Costco, because it's
relatively inexpensive and high quality.

Saturday 20180331

533 normal oatmeal:
    160  1/3 cup Coaches Oats (steel cut oatmeal)
    113 2 tablespoons Nutriva hemp
    120 2 tablespoons Nutriva black chia
     80 Silk soy milk
     60 1/2 tablespoon Udos 3-6-9 Oil

322 large avocado

400 2x 200 calories tailwind

100 roctane gu

??? 2 large bowls of bean soup with rice

322 1 large avocado

 50 1 large orange

 50 1 medium orange

120 1 banana

 15 3 greek olives

 ?? green drink

  3 10 small pickles

1593 + whatever the bowls of bean soup with rice + green drink + rice milk

I also wasn't logging throughout the day and I may have forgotten something.
In theory I burned 3495 calories in 7 hours, 21 minutes and then there's
also my base calorie burn (1,734 calories / day)

If I calculated right, I burned 1,734 + 3495 - (7:21 / 24:00 * 1734) calories
or 4,698 calories today.  If so, then I'm probably running at least a 1,000
calorie deficit which is appropriate for 2 pounds / week.

Hmmm... a different base metabolic calculator figures I need 3,367.42 calories
to keep my typical activity level going without any weight change, but that
probably takes some of the 3,495 into consideration

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunday 20180401

Rode my bike 50 miles before having any calories.  I didn't write down
when I had eaten last, but my guess is I had an avocado yesterday evening
at about 7pm.  I started riding my bike about 7am and didn't finish until
a little before 10am

??? Had a green drink sometime

533 normal oatmeal (at about 10am):
    160  1/3 cup coaches oats
    113 2 tablespoons nutriva hemp
    120 2 tablespoons nutriva black chia
     80 silk soy mil
     60 1/2 tablespoon udos oil

Did I have rice milk?  I didn't write it down, but a week later I'm
suspecting I did, because I typically have rice milk after my bike
ride.  OTOH, we may have been out that day.

Lunch 12:06pm
400? bowl of bean soup with rice (not much rice) -- guessing at type and amount
300? 2nd bowl of bean soup without rice          -- of beans
480 handful of nuts (3 oz) -- In the future, I should probably only have
                              1 to 1.5 oz of nuts at a time
60? bowl of steamed cauliflower
120 medium banana (final lunch food @ 1:21pm)

Snack 3:30pm
200? handful of dates -- 23 calories per date, did I have 9?
120 medium banana
 50 small orange
 50 large orange

Dinner 5:32pm
444? bowl of quinoa -- 222 calories per cup, did I have 2 cups?
240 half brick of tempeh

Snack 6:20pm
480 handful of nuts -- I took these w/o thinking.  I probably should have
                       eaten something else, but I'm in the habit of eating
                       handfuls of nuts

Looks like all told I ate about 2,944 calories

1,734 + 1615 - (1,734 / 8) = 3,132 calories
If all of the above is correct, I probably *didn't* get a 1,000 calorie
deficit in part due to all the nuts.  OTOH, I'm not sure that I'm supposed
to subtract the BMR portion of the day

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monday 20180402 Starting weight 184

Back from my 13.1 mile run, 9:15am
600 normal oatmeal
 50? glass of rice milk

Sophie came back 10:00am?
 50? green drink

Lunch 11:35
675? about two cups yellow lentils (has some water and may not really be 2 cups)

Snack 1:20pm
40 6x small sweet pickles

600 4x vegan tamales
400 bowl of quinoa (Sophie added oil to it w/o realizing I didn't want oil)

snack 5:11
120 medium banana

snack 6:34
240 half brick of tempeh
 50 small orange
 50 large orange
 50? salad

TOTAL: approx. 2925

2915 calories burned 1,734 + 1352 - (1,734 * 142 / 1440)

However, I also did push-ups and sit-ups along the way

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday 20180403 Starting weight 183.5

Back from my 6.55 mile run, 7:45am

533 normal oatmeal
 50? glass of rice milk
 50? green drink

Lunch 11:42
 66 2 cups green beans
300 2x vegan tamales
373 1 cup yellow lentils (I actually measured out a cup, little water)

Snack 2:28 pm
120 medium banana

Dinner 4:30
250 cup of refried beans (Taco Shel)
250 cup of rice (Taco Shel)

Taco Tuesday beer 6:30
285? 8 oz. 13.75% ABV
167? 10 oz. 6.5% ABV

Salad 8:53
50?  small salad (no dressing)
50?  cucumber salad (I'll have to ask Sophie what was in it)
40 6x small sweet pickles

TOTAL: approx. 2,620
2381 calories burned 1,734 + 733 - (1,734 * 71 / 1440)

May not have run a deficit, but considering I had the equivalent of three
beers (over two hours) and came home and ate *something*, I don't appear
to have *gained* any weight and I feel pretty good the morning after (and
am looking forward to some speed work)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wednesday 20180404 Starting weight 183.5

I already know in advance that my snack is coming from the ARR free food
at 7pm, so I need to time things accordingly

Back from my 13.1 mile run (with intervals), 9:30am

488 normal oatmeal:
    160  1/3 cup coaches oats
    113 2 tablespoons nutriva hemp
    120 2 tablespoons nutriva black chia
     35 silk almond / coconut milk
     60 1/2 tablespoon udos oil

 50? glass of rice milk
 50? green drink
120 quarter brick of tempeh

Lunch 12:13
700? Yellow lentils that Sophie doctored up with chickpeas, spinach and red
     pepper.  The good thing is no oil was added, however, it's less protein
     dense and I really have no idea how many calories are in it.

     I'll add a salad and some pineapple and then plan on eating more
     tempeh for my snack, since today I ran 13.1 and I'm doing core

 75 cup of pineapple (raw, not in syrup) probably less than a cup
 50 small salad (darker greens than previous)

Snack ?2:47? -- forgot to write down the time
120 quarter brick of tempeh

dinner at 5pm
700? other bowl of doctored yellow lentils
 60? bowl of steamed cauliflower & broccoli
 50 small orange
 50 large orange
138 6 dates

snack 7pm ARR meeting
??? 2 pieces of broccoli with guacamole

Didn't try summing the calories from yesterday or estimating the
deficit, but I lost 1.5 pounds (see below).  Some of that may just be
due to random fluctuations with how much I pooped in the morning (a
lot!), but overall I think my estimates are so loose that it's not
worth the time for me to sum them up and estimate my deficit, *as long
as I carefully restrict myself and keep watching the numbers*.

Wednesday 20180418 Starting weight 175 (expect no loss or gain tomorrow)

I didn't plan on having three pints yesterday, but one of the Team RWB
members forgot that he was having surgery the next day and ordered a
Stella and then realized he couldn't drink it, so I had it, then I
ordered a stout, liked it and had another one.  I didn't eat after
coming home, nor did I drink anything.  As such, I may be partially
dehydrated, although it was also chilly last night--we left the
windows open--and perhaps my body burned even more fat than normal to
keep warm, although I did grab my sleeping bag around 3am.

Thursday 20180419 Starting weight 175.25

My quarter pound weight gain is not too surprising, since I had lost
two pounds in the prior day.  The two pound loss was probably
partially due to me having had three beers and no water as my last
thing consumed the evening prior, so yesterday morning's weight was
probably lower than normal due to lack of water.  I think my diet
yesterday was fine considering it was both a 13.1 w/intervals and a
core exercise day.

This was the Cedro Peak 50k.  I skipped breakfast and accidentally didn't
eat my avocado, because I never touched my Cedro Peak drop bag.  I had
prepared two avocados.  I should have eaten a bunch more at the aid
stations, but the potato chips weren't holding the guac well and I still
had olive left.

Thursday 20180426 Starting weight 171.5
I may have overcompensated for the beer by eating too lightly yesterday or
it could just be whatever source of randomness in weight fluctation just
happened to favor me today.

8.9 mile 31.5# pack run
First post-BMDM pack run.  Used my SAR pack w/o some standard stuff, 'cause
that's how it was packed and I didn't think it was too important to have 40#
seeing how my right ankle is still slightly swollen.  This is just to get
back into the swing of things (and also give me a little more exercise than
a normal Thursday, since I won't get my full exercise up at Philmont on
Saturday and might not get my full exercise on Sunday, either).

Breakfast @ 8:15 (roughly; forgot to write it down)
533  normal oatmeal (after 8.9 mile run)
 50? 16 oz. rice milk
 50? green drink

9:45 snack

20? small amount of peas & green beans left over from lunch
160 1 oz mixed unsalted nuts
130  medium banana

4:00 snack
 60 4 oz. pineapple (because it was there)

5:00 dinner
155? 2/3 cups brown lentils
500? more, but different lentils & matpe beans
300? avocado

6:00 beer
335? Petrus 16 oz. 8.5% ABV

NOTE: Friday, Saturday and Sunday are all even more inaccurate than
      normal due to me driving to and attending ESCAPE.  That
      prevented me from weighing myself at my normal time on Friday
      and at all on Saturday or Sunday (actually, I weighed myself
      when I got back on Sunday, but that was about 3:10pm, so I
      didn't record it).  ESCAPE had a nice menu for vegetarians and a
      fairly decent salad bar for vegans, but they didn't really
      appear to have many (any?) protein sources for vegans, so I ate
      seitan, tempeh and 2 dehydrated meals.  I also didn't exercise
      as much as normal, although I did do two 32# (estimated) pack
      runs.

      When I got back from ESCAPE, I had an Avery Beast Grand Cru and
      I think the bottle said it was 17.4% ABV (the ABV varies per year).
      That not only added a bunch of calories, but it also reduced my
      willpower and I ate some dates that I probably didn't need to
      eat (they were in a baggie; I took them "just in case").  I may
      have also eaten stuff I didn't write down.

      I suspect I didn't lose any weight at ESCAPE and I won't be too
      surprised (although I'll be disappointed) if I gained weight.

Monday 20180430 Starting weight 172.5

I gained a pound over the ESCAPE weekend instead of continuing with my
weight loss.  I suspected that would happen.  Oh well.  If I hadn't
had the beer when I got back I probably wouldn't have gained as much,
but I did eat well and got in some good (although a tiny amount) of
exercise while I was up at Philmont.

Breakfast @ 9:00

160  1 oz. mixed nuts (5g protein)

~130g protein.  I probably didn't need to eat the tempeh to get the
101 grams of protein _Racing Weight_ claims a vegan athlete of my
weight needs, however today was both 13.1 miles *with* intervals and
core exercise (100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups and 60 squats), so perhaps
having some extra isn't too bad.


Tuesday 20180501 Starting weight 170

250? 16 oz 6%? ABV Chocolate Porter

Wednesday 20180502 Starting weight 170

Not too surprising that I didn't lose weight after a seemingly 2.5
pound loss the previous day.  However, I didn't gain any, even though
I had around 800 calories of beer last night.

Breakfast @ 9:00
533  normal oatmeal (after 13.1 mile run)

160  1 oz. mixed nuts

7pm Snack
150 pretzel with hummus
 30 5x pringles

Thursday 20180503 Starting weight 171

Should have skipped the tamales since they were largely empty
calories.  Should have had less pineapple and strawberries, since
they're high in sugar. Should have skipped the 7pm snack, although
normally they have veggies.  Taking a step backward is annoying,
especially since I didn't feel particularly hungry much of yesterday,
so my eating was based more on "I can do this within my calorie count"
rather than "I need to eat something because my hunger is distracting"

     Sophie had already mixed the rice and beans.  It was about a 1 1/4 cup.
     There was maybe 3/4 cup  of steamed broccoli, squash and zucchini.
     I was hungry, so I threw the remaining veggies and topped it off with
     black beans and added a lot of the black bean broth.  I don't have a
     good feel for how many calories were in it, but I normally eat at 5
     and was exceedingly hungry.

150? 3/4 cup remaining black beans
240  3x Cara Cara orange

Elevation Insanity

We started hiking at 12:00:01 am.  I did not have any food after
dinner and before I got to the truck after the first ascent, which was
approximately 4:45am.  That's when I had my first caffeine.  I did not
write down what I ate and when, but I know that I consumed roughly the
following.  I brought "emergency" gels and Tailwind but never used
them.

We only made 5 ascents, but we were on our feet pretty much from the
start until approx. 8pm (20 hours), although we got a little time to
sit waiting for the tram and driving to trailheads.  We were actually
doing hikes for 15:51:24 and went approximately 33.83 miles, climbing
approximately 20,698 ft.

Sunday 20180506 Starting weight unknown (was in hurry to get to the zoo)

Run for the Zoo half marathon

I got up at my regular 5:15 and decided to see if I could get to the
zoo early enough to register for RftZ 1/2.  I didn't have any food
before.  Afterward I wound up eating leftover food from Elevation
Insanity, including the following.  I did not keep track of when I ate
or *exactly* what I ate (especially the dates and nuts).  I don't
think I ate anything but the popsicles, keva juice and beer other than
Elevation Insanity leftovers until dinner.

4 popsicles
3 tiny platic cups of keva juice

Tuesday 20180508 Starting weight 168.0

No loss and maybe a tiny gain, but that's not too surprising after
such a big loss, especially with eating the mystery calorie pizza and
only running half my normal Monday distance.  The next two weeks will
be tricky since I'm on my taper.

Not quite down to 167.75, but definitely a little under 168.0.
Tonight is RubiABQ, so that may make further losses difficult.  OTOH,
this morning is a 36# pack run, so we'll see.  My pack is only 36
pounds because I'm using my SAR pack (w/o the water bladder) exactly
as it is currently configured.  I'll resume training with my Kelty
pack after I get it kitted up with food (or weights!).

Thursday 20180510 Starting weight 167.5

1:00 Breakfast after running 4.45 mi
Breakfast was late because we had a SAR mission that had us drive up north
of Santa Fe, then turn around.  I chose not to eat anything before going on
my taper 4.45 mile run.

533  normal oatmeal (after 5.55 mile 36.5# pack run)

Friday 20180511 Starting weight 167.75

Beer with food was probably what did me in.  That SAR mission certainly
threw off my schedule.  There's a chance that by eating so late my weight
is up simply because not everything I ate yesterday has passed through me,
but for now I'll simply assume I had too many calories, especially since I
am on my taper.  Speaking of which, today I start my 1/4 distance taper,
so I need even fewer calories...

7:00 Breakfast (after 3.22 mile run: 1/4 distance taper)

FWIW, my plan is to not drop any more weight between now and Thursday morning,
which will be the last day I have access to our home scales before I get back
on Monday.  I am not going to fret if I lose a little or even gain a little
during this time or after Cruel Jewel.  I'm going to wait until after I feel
stable after CJ100 before I resume losing.

650? normal oatmeal (after 4 mile run with 3x 75 second all-out intervals)
     I had made some oatmeal prior to a SAR mission and it was in the fridge.
     I started eating it, but it had a bit of a sour taste.  Eventually I
     threw what was remaining out and made a new bowl, but as I was pouring
     on the soy milk, it was all bubbly and smelled funny.  I tried a forkful
     or two and it was sour, so I threw that out and made another bowl, this
     time with Sophie's almond & coconut (still unsweetened) milk.  So that
     third bowl was less than 533 calories (because the almond and coconut
     milk has less calories than the soy), but I don't know how much I ate
     of the other bowls, which is why I have 650 with a question mark.

Wow. I was just trying not to lose any weight and I went overboard and
gained a pound and a quarter.  Oh well.  Live and learn.  Part of that
is that I only ran 4 miles yesterday rather than my usual Monday 13.1.
That's roughly a 900 calorie change right there.

Looks like the refrigerator probaby was left open overnight, because
three packages of seitan with a "Best Used Before June 19th" label are
all puffed up.  *Perhaps* that's why I got so bloated last night (and
am still bloated); I had attributed it to the 8 cups of beans I had.

food in the gut.  Oh well.

8:15 am (Mountain time) huge snack
Because we had to change planes, I got concerned with my lack of calories, so
I took out a huge bag of nuts and ate about half of them.  I never weighed
the bags, so even if I ate exactly half (and I didn't even try to measure
that), I still wouldn't know how much I ate.

avocado (I took two), pickles and often a handful of skittles and
a stack of Lays version of Pringles.  One aid station had hummus avocado
pinwheels (i.e. wrapped in a flour tortilla).  I ate all they had (they
said they could make more, so I wasn't shorting anyone else).

Hadn't planned on losing weight while I still have this cold, however I
don't think I understand the weight gain and loss associated with CJ100.
I'm not unhappy that I'm back down again.  I'm just surprised.  I still
have enough of a cold that I won't be drinking any beer today, even though
it's Thursday.

Not surprising that I gained weight with all that eating yesterday.
However, I got rid of the nut butter and the extra food may have helped me
recover quicker from the Crest Trail hike, although since I had the leak
in my 2.5 gallon water brick, that wasn't as taxing as it could have been.

drink beer that often...

morning's run and set a PR for 13.1 miles @ 130bpm: 2:15:47 (10:21 min/mile)
although that could have been due to my pre-workout and during workout

Saturday 20180609 Starting weight 165

Due to pigging out yesterday I was overweight, but in theory that would give
me plenty of energy during the Chimney Melon 50k. In reality I wound up with
some cramps that seemed to keep me walking even after I escaped the heat in
the second half of the second loop.

I did not write down what I ate until two days later, but it was
something like:

5:15 breakfast
533 normal oatmeal (25g protein)

during loop 1
3 tablespoons of chia (in water) before the tram
a bunch of mixed nuts
3 tablespoons of chia (in water) after the tram
more mixed nuts

at the truck
one large avocado
24 oz. rice milk
more nuts

during loop 2
3 tablespoons of chia (in water) before the tram
a bunch of mixed nuts
3 tablespoons of chia (in water) after the tram
more mixed nuts

at the truck again
16 oz. rice milk

back at the house
533 normal oatmeal (25g protein)

FWIW, I had made two containers of oatmeal, but forgot to put them in
the cooler, so I wasn't able to eat oatmeal at the truck between loops
1 and 2.

Sunday 20180610 Starting weight 158.5

I got called to a search and rescue mission, so that interfered with my
food logging.

I got called right before I left to go biking.

At the incident base I had a bunch of nuts and eventually my fortified
oatmeal

When I got back, noon was approaching and I had 3 tablespoons of chia
in my water while I did my core exercises

After my core exercises I had (although some of this may have been after lunch)
12 oz. Avery Beast
12 oz. Rochefort 10

Lunch was watery beans, a ton of broccoli, a small salad and maybe more

my dinner was very watery beans with some quinoa and maybe more

I ate at least three oranges after Sophie came back from Costco:
at least one soon after she came back and two right after dinner

Monday 20180611 Starting weight 161

So, I lost 1.75 pounds in the last week and definitely had more chia
while exercising.  Does the smaller weight loss and the increased
protein from chia mean that my loss was a higher percentage of fat
than previously?  I won't know for another five or more weeks, and we
have the family trip between now and then, so it'll still be hard to
tell, but I think it's a good start.

I should have kept track of what I ate during yesterday.  One thing
that I might want to do is pre-package a bunch of 1 oz. mixed nuts
since sandwich baggies are so light.

Surprising gain, seeing how I thought I ate basically what I ate a week
prior.  I'm guessing I underestimated the calorie content of the northern
beans.  There were also some veggies thrown in and perhaps other stuff.
My portions were also on the big side of things.

Today will be tricky, since it's Taco Tuesday.  OTOH, since I only run
8.9 miles and I'm not doing core, I don't need to eat much between now
and then.

Yipes.  I ate way too much yesterday to combat the perceived effort of
doing trail building.  I'm sure a bunch of that weight will disappear by
tomorrow, but it still may be hard to get much further below my Saturday
weight by the time I go for hydrostatic weighing on Thursday.  Oh well.
At least I have my power (I think; I'll know more after my bike ride)

FWIW, I did indeed have my power and managed to ride 35.5 miles in 1:54:25
at a 130bpm avg HR, for an average of 18.6 mph.  That's better than I've done
in the last two years and although it wasn't *hot*, it wasn't cool either.

Monday 20180723 Starting weight 156.00, 50 bpm, 80F

As a test, I wore my HRM for about 12 minutes while in bed with the
lights off from 5:03 to 5:15 before I had my daily double espresso.
The average, once I settled down was 49, the lowest was 46.  There was
a three minute span whose average was 48.

By contrast, the 50bpm in the Starting weight line was taken the way I
normally take my resting HR, which is after I've had my double
espresso and made Sophie's cappuccino and my cereal.  I put my HRM on
and lie back in the La-Z-Boy chair and actively try to calm down and
see the lowest reading I can get the HRM to drop to.  I typically
spend a few minutes waiting for it to settle and then when it gets
almost as low as it will get, I hold my breath and it drops a point or
two and I record that.  Realistically, I think that gets me pretty
close, but it looks like it's two BPM or so high, since I think the
three minute span of 48 best represents a true resting HR, although it
took 12 minutes to find it.

Just like my weights here are always (when I'm in town, at least)
weighed on the same scale and I know that the scale weighs about 2.2
pounds high at my weight, I'm happy to have a consistent way of
measuring my resting HR, and I'll continue to use that method although
I may experiment more with wearing my HRM overnight.

FTR, the temperature is what Wunderground lists for the Heritage Hills
Station that is closest to my house.  I record it at the same time I
record my bpm, which is fairly soon before I leave for my morning run.
My Ambit 3 has a thermometer in it, so my Movescount tracking also has
a temperature range, but the watch's temperature is affected by my own
body heat to some extent, so although I think it's useful to compare
Movescount recorded temperatures between each other, I don't think
they're as accurate as what I get from Wunderground, at least when
I'm near the station involved.

Tuesday 20180724 Starting weight 153.50, 45 bpm, 66F

FWIW, I put on my HRM for a half hour starting at 4:33, figuring I'd
get back to sleep, but I didn't. My average HR for that time was 53,
although it includes a few minutes when I went to the bathroom and my
HR jumped while I was up.  There was a two minute forty seven second
span of an avg HR of 47 in there, so I think 47 would be an
appropriate HR, but using my standard way of measuring after my double
espresso today gave me 45bpm, 2bpm lower, which is funny because
yesterday that method read 2bpm higher, so perhaps it's an acceptable
approximation after all.

I wore my HRM from 03:28 to 05:15 and there was 30 minute span where
my average HR was 48, so I think that suggests that the quick way I'm
calculating (which got me 47 today) is close enough that I don't need
to futz with wearing my HRM in bed anymore.

Saturday 20180728 Starting weight 153.00, 49 bpm, 59F

I couldn't get back to sleep after 2:30, so I got up at 3:30 (alarm
was set at 3:55) and took my double espresso.  The scale is really
reading between 152.75 and 153.00 and my guess is if I had gotten up
at my usual time and weighed myself it would read 152.75 or lower due
to peeing and pooping more.

Ugh.  Didn't get a chance to record calories because I was planning on
counting the remainder of what I brought and using that.  However, I got
called on a SAR mission Sunday morning and wound up using a bunch of
the remainder (and not keeping track of that, either!).

I basically had a full oatmeal before the run, then ate approximately
1,000 calories of nuts and 480 calories of dates and 1,650 calories of
chia and Tailwind on the way to Canyon Estates and then at the
turnaround ate maybe 50 calories of watermelon, 210 of peaches, 100?
of oatmeal, and 70? of rice milk. On the way back I had approximately
1,650 calories of chia and Tailwind, 500? of nuts, 400 of dates.  At
finish I had 70? of rice milk and 100? of oatmeal.  Before bed I had 120
of banana.

Sunday 20180729 Starting weight 151.50, ?? bpm, 66F

Never got bpm.  Got called on SAR mission before I had a chance to measure
it.  I took a bunch of my leftover calories from yesterday with me and also
made myself a brand new oatmeal.  I had some oatmeal in the fridge which I
sampled and then had some of (I think; it might still be in the cooler). I
ate a pear and a banana (I think) on the way up.  I ate two more bananas after
the mission.  I ate a bunch of nuts, perhaps 1,000 calories.  When I got
back, I drank a 12 oz. 14%? ABV Samichlaus beer.

Had lunch, but didn't log it.  I think it was something like 3 cups of
lentils, 2 oranges, a big thing of cauliflower and broccoli, a vegan pizza
crust (just the crust) and some pickles

Monday 20180730 Starting weight 153.50, 53 bpm, 71F

HR was high probably because I had a second double espresso, mostly
just for kicks, but because I might be up a little late playing poker
tonight.  OTOH, having it this early may just make me crash that much
harder.  OTOOH, I'm up two pounds due to my SAR eating (w/o SAR
workout) yesterday so I'm skipping my chia during my interval and am
curious as to how fast I'll run having had extra caffeine today and
extra food and a more or less rest day yesterday.

Using different scale, so I adjusted my weight to what it would read if
we were at home.  Huge (1.5 pound) gain due to drinking and eating nuts
after.  Forgot to write my bpm down at the time. It was surprisingly high,
probably due to the drinking. Definitely started with a 5.

Friday 20180803 Starting weight 155.1 (scale says 152.9),  54 bpm, 81F

Didn't spend much time letting HR settle.  Like my other HR readings in
Las Vegas, this one was taken on the toilet, rather than lieing back on
my La-Z-Boy.

UGH! Didn't record the calories because I was traveling.  I
opportunistically ate a bunch of fruit to get rid of it.  I believe I
had one modified oatmeal that I made before packing the slow cooker.
I ate at least a brick of tempeh.  I ate the remainder of the nuts and
dates I had brought with me.  When I got back home, I think I ate
other stuff, but I could be mistaken.  I'm pretty sure I didn't have
any alcohol to drink.

Saturday 20180804 Starting weight 152.5 / 150.5, 51 bpm, 49F (Santa Fe, Ski)

IIRC, my bpm was 46 sitting on the can in the outhouse.  FWIW, I didn't
record my calories until the next day and so all the info here are just
estimates

Thursday 20180809 Starting weight 151.75 / 149.4, 50 bpm, 63F

Had two double espressos this morning instead of one.  I did so
because I had put extra beans in the coffee grinder and then thought,
well, why not?  That may have lead to a higher HR than I'd have
otherwise.

Yesterday, after getting bad readings on the HRM during my pack run, I
took out the battery and put it in our battery tester and sure enough,
it read low, so I put in a replacement battery.  I had only been using
that battery about two weeks (they usually last several months), but
it was a Sunbeam battery of unknown provenance from a desk drawer and
its replacement is the twin from the same two pack, so I'm guessing
I'll need to change the battery again soon.  I should probably do so
before Leadville, although I don't know how much *MY* HR will matter
when I'm pacing.

Weird weight difference today, but I was in a hurry to get out the door.
I didn't get on the big balance scale until after my tiny pack run (2.21
miles, 40#), but I did get on the electronic one before and after and both
times it read 151.2.  This was before I took a leak after coming back.

After the above, I lost track of what I was eating.  My plan was to not
restrict myself, so I ate some of Marcia's food (vegan lasagna, quinoa) as
well as a ton of fruit, two avocados.  Earlier, during the mandatory briefing
I ate a block of tempeh (although the block may have been a different size
than the blocks I've eaten previously).  I also ate a bunch of Peter's
roasted almonds.  I did not have any of my lentils or beans or any more beer,
at least at the time I'm writing this (2:21pm).

I finished the bananas (four? six?), didn't have any apples or pears,
ate a pluot or two.  I ate a nectarine or two, three or four peaches.



Saturday 20180818 Starting weight 15?.?? / 153.0, ?? bpm, 44F (Leadville)

Not surprising that I gained so much weight.  Assuming this guarantees
that my glycogen stores are topped up, I'm OK with it.  I expect I'll
lose a bunch as I pace Jeff today, although the post race drinking
will probably mean I don't lose very much and so I'll still have a bit
of a hole to climb out of.

Sunday 20180819 Starting weight 15?.?? / 1??.?, ?? bpm, ??F (Leadville)

I was out pacing Jeff on the Leadville Trail 100 race, so I didn't get a
chance to get any measurements, but the water froze at our campsite, so
it was probably < 32F where I would have measured it.

Ate a bunch of crap while pacing, starting with a bunch of potato chips
at the Winfield station before leaving.  I had to poop outside twice and
in a porta potty at least once (probably more than that)

Monday 20180820 Starting weight ??? / 156.5, 54 bpm, 34F (Leadville)

Not too surprising after all the drinking and being completely off my diet
for a few days.  Disappointing.

Started the day with "normal" (fortified with the usual ingredients)
oatmeal I had made the day before and lots of espresso and coffee.

Got $12 of food at Whole Food, including kale, radish, carrot, 4
medium avocados, bananas.  Ate some of it at Whole Food including a half
a package of seitan.

After getting to Denver, drank a lot of different beer with Dave, then
went to an upscale place and had a big tofu dish along with half a
salad and half a thing of soup.  Came back and drank some more with
Lauren.  Right before going to bed I think I ate the rest of the seitan,
a sprig of kale and either some dates or some nuts.


Tuesday 20180821 Starting weight ??? / ???.?, ?? bpm, ??F (Denver)

Slept at Dave and Lauren's.  Didn't want to disturb anyone by getting my
scale out and didn't think to check the temperature.  However, I also didn't
run, so the temperature is pretty irrelevant.

Did not log my food intake, but it was fairly large, eating a bunch of
stuff I had bought at Whole Food the day before as well as a lunch
serving of 4 cups (two full bowls) of red beans and a dinner serving
of the same size (finishing up the beans).  Additionally, I ate
radishes (and their greens), a carrot or two a bunch of pears, at
least 4 oz. mixed nuts (probably closer to 6 or 8), some kale and a
whole bunch (5? 6?) of bananas.  At home I had an Avery sour ale aged
in tequila barrels (meh) and an Ayinger Celebrator.  Had two or three
avocados, too.

Wednesday 20180822 Starting weight 156.0 / 154.2, 54 bpm, 66F (home)

Was raining when I got up, so I didn't do a pack run.  I took some

(mostly Monday and yesterday).

Revised my weight down from 153.9 to 152.7 after I had a 7am (local time)
poop.  My guess is fruit for dinner was a contributing factor.

Friday 20180907 Starting weight ??? / 155.5, 46 bpm, 54F (Homewood CA)

Eating a large pizza didn't help my weight loss, but it probably didn't
hurt my performance for a 200 miler.


Thursday 20180913 Starting weight 164 / 162.6, 47 bpm

Feet and legs still swollen from Tahoe 200.  Balance weight (164) is
from before I ate, but I forgot to record my electronic scale weight
when I took it before eatinmg, so the 162.6 is after oatmeal and green
drink.  Didn't record temperature, because I didn't exercise.

I'm assuming that in the next few days, I'll lose weight as the swelling
goes down.  However, my guess is I'll have still gained a bunch since I
went off my diet before Tahoe 200.  I thought I'd lose weight @ T200; I
didn't anticipate the severe swelling.

I probably shouldn't have gone off my diet quite so hard both before
and to some extent during T200.  I'm pleased with my T200 finish,
especially considering my having stubbed my toe hard on the second
day.  However, it looks like it might be a long time before I'm back
below 150.

ate a bunch of chips on field.  After coming back I more or less ate what
I'd normally eat, although I did have three bananas.  Still, I didn't record

It's a year later (i.e., I'm adding this note in 2019), and I remember
having beer after I got to tent city.  My *guess* is I had at least 3
and less than 6.  I know I didn't do the beer mile, because I haven't
done one ever.  It sounds like fun, but I'm certainly not going to do
it the day before I need a Western States Qualifier (like I did in
2018 and 2019).

It is very likely I had a double espresso at 4:15 and I know I was drinking
coffee from the Keurig machine, but I can't remember exactly which days I
had any; I wasn't really tracking caffeine well back then.

Freak Brothers Pizza

2 apples? (based on notes on what I took to JJ100)

            remaining nuts (ate these Friday night; may want to measure
                            in the future)

Saturday 20181027 I did not record anything in this file at the time, but
I had written (elsewhere):

  Second big takeaway: pay more attention to calories.  I consumed all
  20 of my bags of 2 tablespoons of chia with 2 scoops of tailwind, but
  I also ate like a piggy at many of the aid stations (including my four
  vegan brownies from The Cutting Board).  Consequentially I gained
  weight and I think I was a bit sluggish coming out of some of the aid
  stations.

FWIW, it was 34F when I started and 44F when I finished.  The sun was
up, but there was some haze. I expected full sunshine and rising
temperatures, so I wore shorts and a short-sleeve jersey, supplemented
by arm sleeves and fairly heavy bike gloves.  That was not enough,
because the haze actually increased and I rode relatively quickly.  As
such, I wound up cold enough to have mild hypothermia.  I couldn't use
my hands to get my waterbottle (that had 400 calories of Tailwind in
it) and I had to look at my hands when I put them on the brakes to be
sure I could engage the brakes properly.  My perception of distances
and times got warped and stayed warped even as I warmed up in my truck
on the drive home.  It was surreal.

I never consumed the 400 calories of Tailwind I had, nor did I choose
to drink the cold post-ride rice milk that I had.  I didn't record all
the times I ate mixed nuts, so today's calorie count is likely
inaccurate.

Temperature was at 5:30, but today I won't run until 11:30, since
today is the Black Friday Turkey Trots. HR is ridiculously high,
although I took it at 6:13, after having eaten breakfast. Normally I
take it either before my espresso (if I get out of bed on the early
side of 5:15) or after I've had my espresso but before I do my
exercise, much less have breakfast.  OTOH, I did have the equivalent
of six beers yesterday as well as two bowls of ridiculously sweet
fruit salad.

Jeff dropped by Anodyne last night, so Mike, Jeff and I rotated on the
table, letting the winner continue shooting.  So I was there later
than normal.  Once again I succumbed to hunger at the end.  Part of
that is lack of willpower, but part of it is knowing that I'm no
longer in my "loose weight" off-season.  OTOH, I gained enough during
the holidays that I really should lose some here and there.

Started running late due to a combination of being tired from last night,
wanting to see how much rain we got and having too much fun reading
Programming Rust.  Chose to do a second double espresso to get me moving.

NOTE: I did not record my lottery or mom's house calories at the time of
consumption and may have omitted some.  As it is, I didn't write down
the ABV of the beer I had and the Red Door Brewery website doesn't list
them.  There's also a chance that I had a fourth beer in there, since
I think my first wasn't one of the three listed, but I can't think of
what it was.  So ... I expect to have gained weight today.

HR taken 45 minutes after quad espresso, so is probably higher than if
I had taken it before the espresso or even closer to after consuming
it.  OTOH, my HR probably *is* still high due to the lingering chest
cold.  It's quite possible that had I skipped my hard run on Saturday
and Monday that I'd be 100% recovered by now, but I don't know that
and still think I did the right thing.

Took HR 35 minutes after quad espresso and wasn't patient, so it's higher than
if I had taken it early and taken my time.  I probably still have lingering
side effects from my cold and I probably also ran too hard yesterday to have
had a "normal" HR.

to me not having pooped a second time before eating my cereal.

Ugh. Didn't write much down.  I wound up drinking only about 1.5 of my 2
handhelds during my first run, not because I wasn't thirsty, but because
drinking with puffy mittens is tricky.

I wound up eating 3 servings of oatmeal today and also had 3 quad espressos.
At the Grinch Lunch I also ate a veggie burger with a side salad and had
3 pints of beer.  The first two didn't have an ABV posted with them, but
my guess is it was 6% or less.  The third (Monk's Trippel) was about 9.2%.

I also had a green drink, salad, medium bowl of steamed veggies.

At Marcia & Jeff's I had a Taddy Porter and some vegan Indian food.

When I got home, just slightly after 6pm, I had 3 oz. of mixed nuts
(480 calories) as my final calories.

Weight probably a pound high because I woke up to my alarm and hence
was running late.  As such, I weighed myself and ate my cereal before
my second poop.  HR is also a bit high since I took it after I had my
first quad espresso.  However, it probably would have been higher than
normal anyway, because 57 is awfully high even after a quad.

Yesterday I had too much Tabasco and wound up awake in the middle of the
night again.  I'm thinking about cutting it out entirely, because I suspect
that in smaller amounts it's still interfering with my sleep a little, even
when I don't go fully awake.  I love spicy food, but I think I need to savor
it as a special treat, at least for a while, rather than trying to find a
small dose that I can have more regularly.

HR late and rushed

5:15 wake-up
10 double espresso

My run was supposed to be 15.5, but I chose to skip a loop for many reasons.
I don't know if I'll deliberately try to make up the extra 3.3, but I'll
probably go out again and walk the dog at least.

5:15 wake-up
10 double espresso

5:30 Pre-race calories
533 normal oatmeal
0 200 mg ibuprofen

6:15 pre-race caffeine
20 quad espresso

During the Mt Taylor 50k I chose to have a single 20 oz. handheld,
which I initially had loaded with 2 scoops of Tailwind and 2
tablespoons of chia.  I also had a baggie with another (2 scoops of
Tailwind and 2 tablespoons of chia) setup and a baggie with just 2
tablespoons of chia.  When I ran out of my first set of liquid, I got
water at an aid station and mixed up my baggie that had Tailwind, then
for the rest of the race I always put aid-station-provided Tailwind in
my bottle, except at the 1/2 way point where I had already mixed 2
scoops of my own with 2 tablespoons of chia and water.  I *meant* to
take more baggies of just 2 tablespoons of chia, but I got flustered
at the aid station and forgot to grab them and also forgot initially
to take my quad espresso.

I had too much emergency gear in my 1/2 way drop bag.  I should have
stripped it, especially since I also had access to my finisher's bag.
I need to always have a printed list of the things I need to switch
out; it only takes a few seconds to read such a list.

BTW, taking all that espresso, ibuprofen and chocolate left my stomach
slightly sore, but I don't think that really held me back.  I think a
combination of injury and still not being 100% recovered from Big
Cottonwood held me back much more.  I also knew Eric Pope was gunning
for the 56 year old record and I knew I didn't have it in me to beat
him, so I took my foot off the gas and had a great day.

Although I wrote down some of the calorie sources I was bringing with
me, I didn't write down what I ate post race until the following day.

51.4F 20 minutes after (forgot to record it)

Today was an experiment, in that on the Tuesday after DCM and before
JJ100 last year, I ran my 8.9 miles much later in the day and after a
bunch of calories.  I started later after a false start where I
returned very early due to lightning.

Today, to some extent I tried to eat similarly (although last time
there were homemade calzones) and ran at 8:40 to see just how quickly
I can run my standard 8.9 mile (to Albuquerque Academy, two loops
around, and back) Tuesday run at 130bpm.  It wouldn't have been a fair
comparison due to differences in temperature, humidity and wind
anyway, but I was getting some pretty heavy HR swings that makes me
think I can't trust the numbers at all.

FWIW, I *felt* great.  If I had known that I wouldn't trust the HR
results, I would have just chosen a pace around 9 minutes a mile and
held on to it to see if I could do that with the same feeling as a
130bpm HR.  Oh well.  I can do interval training tomorrow and then
compare my non-HR interval stats with those from interval training
yesterday and figure out if yesterday's and today's trainings were net
*short term* wins (I'm sure they were worthwhile overall).

Did not bring a scale, but between my drinking and eating yesterday, I
assume I'm up three or four pounds.  I shouldn't have eaten a single
piece of candy, but rather than wallow in self-pity for my lack of
willpower, I'll remember that it really did taste good at the time and
I won't be doing it again (in a while!), so I'll own it as a happy
memory.

HR was after caffeine, although I did take a rushed reading before
that was higher (50bpm).  I don't actually think that the caffeine
lowered my HR.  I think that a combination of worse sleep due to
alcohol and heat combined with a different sleeping location prevented
me from waking up with a low HR.  Maybe next year I should make it a
point to see how low I can get my HR, although this year is 2 bpm
lower than last year.

I didn't bring Udo's 3-6-9 with me, too messy, so I bought a half
dozen avocados @ Bashas along with a bunch of the other veggies and
fruit.  I ate some veggies and fruit yesterday and will eat the rest
when I get back from JJ100.  I'm doing a jalf-assed low-fiber protocol
today; that *may* be a bad idea since it typically causes minor
problems the "day after" a marathon, which could happen during JJ100.
FWIW, I've never actually summed the amount of fiber I have on a
normal day, so I don't (yet?) have a feel for how getting my fat from
avocados rather than oil changes things.

FWIW, I completely screwed up my nutrition in a few ways: first, by pre-mixing
my water w/ chia seeds and Tailwind, it started to ferment or spoil and didn't
taste good at all, so it didn't really seem like I was taking in calories, even
though I did drinkk most of  it.  However, I also mixed up my drop-bags and
then over-corrected by bringing my 3 remaining baggies (I only had 17 bottles
with me, so I couldn't mix all 20 baggies) down from Jackass Junction (where
they were needed!) to JQ.  So then I tried to split up my bottles by only
drinking one mixture on the way to JJunction, so I'd have the other on my
way down, but that led me to binge eat other foods.  Ugh!

Oh, and doing a low fiber protocol the day before was *probably*
counter productive

FWIW, I think all the carbs I ate this morning was a bad idea.  I
should have *at most* had a normal cereal first thing after pooping,
although perhaps 2 or 3 slices of bread earlier but no tortillas or
gels would have been worthwhile.

I definitely should have checked my bite valve before starting because
running out of water was annoying, although it occurred after I had
done my intervals.

Started out wearing a fleece hat, arm sleeves, singlet and shorts,

off the hat about three quarters of the way in. My fingers got cold,

I decided not to run today.  My quad espresso never really woke me up
and various other minor things contributed to me not getting out the
door.  In fact, I basically had a down day and didn't do any
significant coding, either.  The Bosque Boogie beat me up a fair
amount due to all the slipping and sliding.  That winds up using
muscles in ways that a normal 50k doesn't use.

I did two runs today because I had to have routine maintenance done on
my truck, so I drove it down to Affordable Automotive, then ran back
home, tacking on an AA loop to get my run up to slightly more than 6
miles.  Then, when it was ready, I ran back down.

I didn't steam my cruciferous veggies when I normally do, due to my
run, so today's morning exercise and calories were a little different
from a normal Tuesday's, but not by much.

tamales and sweet potato were probably a lot more carbs than normal

although I'm going to do it w/o morning pre-run calories

FWIW, I may have had the oomph, but it was relatively warm, albeit the
high humidity helped it feel slightly cooler.  I did not run with my

Monday 20191209 weight 15?.? ?? @ ?:?? 30F @ 1:00 (top of crest, car thermometer)

I got called out on a search-and-rescue mission at about 11:30 Sunday
night.  I got out the door at about midnight and got to the top of the
crest just slightly after 1am.  I could not get the Sienna to the
parking spaces at the top, but Jesse helped me at least get the
Sienna to a safe place out of the way.

I was a useful member of team one, although Jesse and Bill led the
way, with Jesse doing trail finding.  The subject was a little below
the stairs on the Crest Trail Spur.  We went down in our snowshoes,
but should have used micro-spikes instead.

I mostly carried stuff, then, after the subject was safely in an
ambulance, I misplaced my keys and wound up going back (by that time
it was daylight) to look for them.  It's a bit of a long story, but I
was convinced my keys were with my phone and they weren't.  My phone
had slid off the console presumably when the Sienna was slipping and
sliding up at the top and out of sight is out of mind, so my keys were
in a baggie by themselves and I later repurposed that baggie to hold
various Jet Boil parts because I didn't have time or finger
coordination to get the Jet Boil back into a cohesive unit (and the
baggie that normally held the Jet Boil had been repurposed).

Anyway, I wound up eating 3 gels while the subjeft was being attended
to, not because I needed calories, per-se, but because I let my
fingers get very cold (because I had switched to my very warm, but
totally awkward mittens, but that meant I had to take my hands out of
the mittens completely to do a bunch of tasks, including repeatedly
handling the subject's completely frozen pants and shoes that I had
volunteered to schlep about.

Altuough I was wearing my Ambit 3, I must have either accidentally
turned it off when I thought I was locking the controls or turned it
off when getting into my pack and then forgot to lock it (or perhaps I
locied it after turning it off).  So, my exercise log has guesses for
that activity.  Normally I don't write down much detail in this file
for SAR missions because my saved exercise data reminds me what I
did...

FWIW, the subject was taken to the firehouse down the mountain and I
had to go there to retrieve some of the clothing I had lent him.  So I
got to see that he did not get any frostbite.  He still had some
tingling in his toes, but he could feel all of them which was *MUCH*
better than when we found him.  Yay!

I didn't have a quad espresso because I'm feeling a bit sick and was
leaning toward not doing today's pack run.  Elvis had a 102 fever and
was sent home from school yesterday.  Iris didn't go to school
yesterday.  I have a small amount of stuff in my lungs and may have
had a fever a couple of days ago.  However, I did my fiber protocol
yesterday and the weather is good.  Tomorrow's CiSAR litter evaluation
is easy, so I'll do today's pack run and just expect it to go poorly
but to get it over with.

Still sick.  HR was after caffeine, because I woke up to my alarm
rather than my own.  I did not sleep through the night due to fever,
so I reluctantly had an ibuprofen and stayed awake for about a half
hour afterward.  I'm definitely feeling much better and may suit up
and run a small amount today, but only after the sun is shining.

I took 200mg ibuprofen after being called on a search and rescue
mission in the mountains.  I have minor body aches lingering from the
flu.  They actually interfered with my sleep last night, but I was too
stubborn to take anything for them.  I was planning on not taking
anything today, but I didn't want to be unduly uncomfortable on the
mission.  However, the road to the top was horrendous and they already
had people on their way, so our team was asked to stand down.  IOW, if
I had waited until I was closer to incident base, I wouldn't have
taken it, *BUT* it takes a little while to kick in, so I don't regret
that I did.

HR was almost an hour after having caffeine.  Didn't sleep well last
night, probably due to the caffeine and alcohol I had during the day.
This morning I made Sophie a cappuccino, that she didn't want, so I
drank it, even though it wasn't vegan.  It would have just been thrown
out otherwise.

I screwed up and accidentally cut about 2 miles of the course on the
lower half.  I sort of made up for it, I think, by running some extra
distance east up toward the mountans before having to head back west
again.  However, when I was trying to use my Ambit 3 to navigate (I
should have used my phone!)  I accidentally stopped and then erased my
earlier tracks.  I think I was around 16 miles when that happened.  I
started tracks again and logged 13.95 miles, finishing just a little
before 3pm (i.e. just under seven hours).

FWIW, my post-flu junk in lungs really got to me as did body-aches
which is why I took 200 mg of ibuprofen.

Chose to run 5.6 instead of 13.1 so I'll have more oomph for my 21
mile pack run tomorrow.  Last year I didn't run at all (due to rain)
the day before the equivalent run and I did very well and largely
adopted a no Friday runs policy for the rest of my BMDM training.  So,
I considered not running at all, but there was new snow on the ground
and I also have been running erratically due to the long tail of the
flu, so I decided to do 5.6 and see how tomorrow goes.

Similarly, instead of doing a low-fiber protocol today, I'm doing a
medium fiber, which allows me to have what I consider my optimal
recovery food (oatmeal) early, but switches to spaghetti for the bulk
of my calories.

medium-fiber experiment:
533 normal morning cereal
50? green drink
 50? 16 oz. rice milk
no salad
no cruciferous veggies
no beans
no lentils

hand warmers in my gloves.  At the turnaround stopped, took off my
pack, took off my shirts, put my T-shirt back on and stuffed the
long-sleeve shirt, the armwarmers and hat into my pack.  I also had my
3rd quad espresso of the day then.  Due to cold hands, that stop took
me 6 minutes.  I also walked four minutes at one pont (about 18 miles
in) while I stuffed my gloves and hand warmers into my side pockets
and filled one of my hand-helds from my bladder.

So, I think I lost ten or more seconds per mile dealing with the cold.
I also may have lost some time due to being over dressed.  At 20F, I
probably shouldn't have had that long-sleeve shirt on underneath.
OTOH, my toes already had some suspicious blisters that could have
been from frost-nip earlier in the week and today was a bit of an
experiment.

I did remember to use my North Face water bottle rather than my other
UD bottle (the one with the broken strap), but I really do need a new
handheld with a strap that I can adjust.  The NF bottle's strap is a
bit tight when I have a handwarmer in a glove on the hand that is
using that bottle and too tight of a strap then cuts into my
circulation, exacerbating the cold.

Unlike my previous bosque runs, I didn't need to stop to pee or poop.
The lack of peeing may have been due to all the sweating I did with
the extra layers.  The lack of pooping may have been due to my medium
fiber protocol yesterday.  OTOH, both might simply be due to me being
much less under the influence of the flu than previously.

I did not take my HR the way I normally do.  Instead, I put my HRM on
at 4:49 and went back to bed (tried to sleep) to see what it would
look like over an extended period (26:31).  It did not look good.  My
average was 60bpm, but there were tons of higher and lower portions.
I did have a minute and a half of 55bpm average.

Did not poop before I started doing my core exercises, just like two
days ago.  However, unlike then, the exercise didn't get me going, so
I had about 3/4 of my green drink before my 3rd set of sit-ups.  I did
poop about ten minutes after finishing my core, so I weighed myself
then, but one could argue that my weight today is about 12 oz. too

I was supposed to have a quad espresso when I woke up, which is either
one full Hammer gel flask, or two half full flasks.  However, I had
filled all three of my flasks, so I had six double espressos
available, with the idea that I'd have two today and then have two on
standby for tomorrow.  But when I woke up this morning, I forgot that
I had done that, but I did remember that I was going to do a pack
speed run today, so I drank two full flasks w/o thinking about it.
Then I wound up drinking my third flask before going running.

I don't have experience with the new thermometer at the summit.  It
may be the same one they previously used to feed Weather Underground
their information.  I'm going to dress assuming it's typical below
freezing but not far below freezing, but I'll bring emergency layers
for pre-race and post-race.

HR was post caffeine and very rushed, but probably would have been
high anyway due to my two beers last night while playing poker and my
rough sleep.  I wonder if there's any chance the coffee I had at
Michael Thomas wasn't decaf.

My truck thermometer said 27F when I pulled into the parking lot at
about 7:45am this morning.  Having not gotten to sleep until after
midnight, I'm not surprised that my HR was high.  I have consumed a

good sleep to do a decent training run tomorrow.

Surprised that my HR was so high.  I went to bed early last night and
slept a few hours before waking up here and there.  I would have
guessed that between not running much yesterday and all the sleep that
my HR would be down to 47 or so.  OTOH, my sleep was definitely
fragmented, partially due to my thinking about my poker work.

New HRM battery.  Oh yeah, I got up in the middle of the night to
change it because I couldn't sleep and I had been getting some dodgy
readings lately.  I think I may go to changing it once a month as an
experiment.

I did not sleep well last night.  Considering I had two low caffeine
days in a row, I attribute much of it to all the salsa I had.
However, I'm also in a very exciting phase of my poker work and that
certainly interfered with me getting to sleep on time.  To be safe,
I'm going to go back to no salsa between now and BMDM, and I'm also
going to go back to "no brain work after 8pm", which will include
reading email, especially poker-related email.

BTW, although I forgot to check the temperature after I got back,
there's a storm coming in, so two hours after I finished the temp had
only risen 2F from my reading three and a half hours prior.  Normally
there'd be over a 10F rise during that time period (I think).

I went to bed around 6pm.  I did have trouble sleeping from around
1:30 to 2:30, as well as my need to get up and pee about 5 times.  I
woke up around 4:50.

Yesterday was a down day due primarily to lack of sleep the night
before (too much caffeine), but presumably compounded by only having a
single espresso in the morning rather than my normal double.

5:15 wake-up
5 single espresso

6:30 no-exercise breakfast

10:30 carb snack
??? large bowl (the rest) of spaghetti, no tofu, no oil
    FWIW, we didn't have two complete packages of the spaghetti I
    normally eat that is 1890 calories, so I eyeballed enough of a
    different spaghetti (whose calorie content I don't know) to make
    approximately the same volume of spaghetti as the 1890 package.
    As of 10:30, I've eaten all of that first batch.  Later this
    afternoon I'll eat a second batch that I made from a complete,
    1890 calorie, package.

11:30 lunch

I totally screwed up my caffeine plan by accidentally packing in my
bike/run transition bag one of my Hammer gel flasks with a quad
espresso in it.  I woke up in the morning and couldn't find that
flask, so I took two cups of coffee from the hotel with me to drink
instead of the quad espresso, but that may easily have been more
caffeine.  Still, when I got to the bike/run transition I drank half
the flask (i.e., a double espresso).  Then, I felt like I had too much
caffeine for a while, so didn't have any more until I had finished the
snowshoe down (I think), when I had half the flask that I had packed
in my snowshoe bag.

However, when I was preparing my flasks I actually had some extra
espresso left over and wound up topping up my flasks.  I haven't
actually measured how much extra that was, but I certainly felt
overcaffeinated during and after the run, although I also ate one and
a half dark chocolate bars, so perhaps the extra theobromine (?
600mg?) added to what I was feeling.

Wunderground is not working right, so it's hard for me to tell what
the temperature is.  It's allowing me to use the 429 url, but when I
choose the change panel to see the stations nearby, 429 isn't listed,
nor are any others that are particularly close.  Wunderground used to
be pretty solid but slowly they've devolved.  If this doesn't clear up
in a couple of weeks, I'll have to figure out something else.

Because I had cleaned the neck of the bottle, when I started pouring
the hot sauce, a ton came out.  I chose to microwave the bowl and then
see just how spicy it was.  My idea was that if it was too spicy, I'd
dilute it.  It seemed fairly spicy to my mouth, but not *that* spicy.
I guess my mouth is used to it now, because after I ate it I started
sweating profusely.  My stomach also complained just a little, but it
had already been upset (and quieted down) from my morning ibuprofen on
an empty stomach (albeit w/ 16 oz. water) followed by 3 double
espressos.

https://www.wunderground.com/weather/us/nm/albuquerque/KNMALBUQ591
46.6F at end

HR measured differently than normal. I did not sleep well last night, mostly
due to stress, but also compounded by a search-and-rescue callout that I
did not go on (Margaret's upcomimg BMDM experience is higher priority).  So,
when I woke up a little before 5am, I put my HRM on and then tried to get
back to sleep.  The 54 bpm is my HR right before I woke up.

Normally I put my HRM on, lie down, wait until my HR goes down about
as low as I think it will in a minute or two and then hold my breath
and record the lowest reading I see, because that is quicker than
trying to be relaxed for fifteen minutes and experimentally--although
with very few trials--this appeared to give similar results to wearing
my HRM over night and then looking for the low spots.  My
breath-holding methodology appears to be consistent with itself from
day today, but it may have diverged from the longer protocol and it
undoubtedly produces a number that is lower than what most people
would claim is their resting HR.

Anyway, like last year, both my weight and my resting HR has crept up
as BMDM approaches.  Neither are particularly worrying, although I had
planned on doing better on both this year.

Got to bed late for me last night due to going to O'Niell's after RubiABQ.
Elvis had some sort of stomach bug and was up much of the night throwing
up, so that too interfered with my sleep.  As such, I woke up to the alarm
clock and didn't take my HR until after I had done my core exercise.  Cocoa
Conspiracy is canceled, Sophie isn't working and the kids have the day off
from school, so I hung out at home until Sophie wanted her cappuccino.

Anyway, my HR would have been higher had I taken it at my normal time.
It was definitely higher when I took it an hour and a half after my
core exercise (55 bpm @ 7:58)

??.?F at end (truck thermometer) -- forgot to check, was too trashed

weight was pre-pooping, HR was rushed and after ~3 double espressos I
had sufficiently annoying flu-like body aches last night that it
interfered with my sleep.  Additionally, I hadn't really thought
through the GI repercussion of a 4:30 start until I woke up.  So, I
wound up taking ibuprofen after all (due to the body aches) and also
had my caffeine earlier than I planned with the hopes that I'd be able
to empty my GI tract sooner, rather than later.  Oh, and I didn't do
the complete low-fiber protocol yesterday in part because of various
issues that were still up in the air (my upcoming trip to Phoenix)
when I started preparing my food.

The good news is I didn't have to stop to poop along the way.  The bad
news is I desperately wanted to.  I'm glad I got the early start
though.  In some sense it would have been more realistic for me to
start at 6:30, but seeing how I was running a flat course in road
shoes, the difference between today and a real BMDM were going to be
overwhelming regardless, so getting it out of the way early was the
right thing to do.

Today was weird. Team RWB canceled our standing Sunday get-together,
so I planned on getting to the Alameda Open Space just before 7am so I
could ride my bike some distance and then drive home.  Since I had
pushed myself somewhat yesterday, I figured I might ride 10 or 20
miles, but ...

...when I got there, Joe was there.  Nobody had told him that the Team
RWB meeting was canceled. So I walked with Joe for about an hour.
When we got back to the parking lot, we ran into KK and Jerry, so we
chatted a bit, then I finally started my bike ride.

Riding back, I ran into Roleen, so I reversed direction and rode with
her a little bit.  After getting back to the truck, George and Nora
pulled up, so I rode with them.  Along my ride I stopped a couple
times to visit with Tova.

So, I wound up riding 66.95 miles today when I wasn't even sure I was
going to ride 10.  I also walked 2.77 miles with Joe, before riding.

I had planned on returning my diet to its normal schedule today, but
all the unscheduled riding totally interfered with that, as did the
additional calories I burnt.  The beer I had hit me hard and I wound
up taking a nap before even finishing it.

      into the 1/2 tablespoon measure.  I quickly caught myself, but not
      before a ton (5 tablespoons?) went in to the cereal.  I thought about
      throwing it away or skimming the oil off for future use, but I decided
      to top off the remaining portion with soy milk, stir it up and take a
      bite.  It tasted fine.  We'll see what happens ...

I did not sleep well last night due to a combination of the caffeine,
all the salsa I ate and the state of my poker software.  In particular,
I added logging to the database and it had several issues, all of which
were fairly easily fixed, so although I tried to resist temptation, I
wound up fixing them all except one and then going back to bed.

Forgot to look at the temp before I started, but it was probably over 60

Screwed up with temperature.  Thought I was going to ride my bike, but
forgot that the grill in my truck is broken and potentially a danger,

didn't look at thermometer, because I got tangled up in poker stuff and
did not exercise in the morning

HR was high in part because I woke up just before 5:15 and by the time
I had my HRM on the 5:15 alarm went off while I was trying to take
this morning's reading.  Still, I was excessively tired yesterday and
perhaps I've overtrained.  My training schedule certainly doesn't look
like that to me, however, I don't feel I'm 100% recovered from
whatever lung infection I had about a month ago, so perhaps that's
part of the puzzle.

73.6F half hour after finishing

HR was legitimately high; this was not me pressed for time.  I didn't
really feel well this morning, although I didn't feel sick, either.
OTOH, I hadn't exercised in a while and am also aware that my HR
*could* be due to low battery, even though I don't think so.  Anyway,
I decided to caffeinate up and then run using the hand-helds I had in
the fridge from Monday's non-run (due to truck bezel replacement).

This is my longest streak of non-running due to non-health,
non-recovery issues.  Saturday I didn't run because I didn't have a
plan in place for the morning and I wound up programming and never
going running.  There may have been other issues, but it's so long ago
I can't remember.  Sunday, our SAR team was asked to volunteer to
prepare food boxes for relief, so I did that.  It was exercise,
although non-aerobic.  Monday, I had to take my truck in to have the
bezel installed.  Yesterday I had a bunch of things to do in
preparation for the evening's tournament and I simply coded from the
time I got up until an hour before the tournament and by that time it
was too late.

So, I figured with all that rest, I'd have a nice low resting HR, but
that was not the case.  One thing that I've been doing lately is
adding *a lot* of Tabasco to make up for running out of Andrew's
Insanity Sauce.  I don't *think* that's an issue, but I'm going to
back off.  I've also found that my lungs get cranky after just a
little (equivalent of two beers) alcohol, so no beer for me until
Saturday or Sunday.

73.0F @ end (8:34) -- didn't check it right before I ran.  Oops.

Yesterday's O'Niell's was an exercise in poor judgment.  I ordered
french fries because I hadn't had them in a while and the amount they
gave me was huge, so I ate them all.  Pre-lockdown O'Niell's had more
vegan options, but yesterday they only had the Impossible Burger and
buffalo cauliflower wings.  Since I had done a ruck run earlier in the
day I went with the IB, but I should have had a side of fruit (like
Margaret did!) instead of the fries.

I didn't have any water or calories until after spud patch.  I got lost
and wound up doing some bushwhacking.  I had my 3rd double espresso at
about mile 10.  I drank some chia water.

At Rock Tank, my big calorie source was a bunch of oatmeal.  I ate
three fig newtons that were supplied by (I believe) the Gordons.  I
also drank a beer. I wound up putting all 6 tablespoons of chia into
my two bottles, even though one of them already had a lot of chia water
stilll in it.  That was a mistake, although I did use aid station water
to thin it out later.

I did not eat any nuts during the race, nor did I use any Tailwind or
gels.  This was not a strategy, per-se.  I really didn't plan my
nutrition, nor did I try to optimize for speed.

and Derek.  They were walking around Albuquerque Academy carrying
U.S. flags to commerate Veteran's Day.  I walked with them, which was
a little tricky because I wound up needing to take a pee break due, in
part, to not sweating as much and also not finishing as quickly.

Never did exercise today.  Got to the kitchen to fill my water bottles
and found I'm in arrears for some taxes.  That triggered a "family
discussion" and by the time I was done it was too close to lunch for
me to want to leave and after lunch I didn't really have the energy.
Today has not been a good day, but it's probably a (painful) step in
the right direction.

try the ignition in my truck.  It wasn't working yesterday.  HR in
Sophie's van was around 47 bpm, I think.  Temperature was about 30F
before I turned it off.

Roleen, Rhoda and Demetria from Team RWB came out, but they wanted to
walk and I wanted to run, so I ran to and crossed the bridge, then ran
back.  I hung out until the walkers returned, then I drove over to

Huge weight gain due to all the bread (including tortilla) I ate
yesterday.  It was an experiment.  I was tired all of yesterday and
wanted to see if eating more would perk me up.  It didn't.  I enjoyed
eating the bread (it was homemade) but I don't think it helped
(although I'm writing this *before* my pack speed run).

In addition to eating a ton of carbs yesterday, I'm also doing a few
other things different than my 7 mile speed run in 2018.  I had a
double espresso at my standard time, but I'm drinking two more one
half hour before I run.  Additionally, I'm going to run at 6:45 rather
than 6:30 so that there will be more light (although that may mean I
wait longer at the stoplight at Barstow and Harper).

Just before my run I am also going to drink the Tailwind I had
leftover from Saturday's run.  That way I don't have to try to draw
from the bladder that doesn't work very well during my run although as
it is, I can't get the last bit of Tailwind out of my Amphipod bottles
easily while running.

I'm also switching to my Speed 3 playlist from my Speed 9 last week.

It was about 10F when I woke up. I chose to wait and run much later
than normal.  I also knew that my intervals were going to suck both
due to having run a 50k two days prior and it being cold enough that I
had to wear too much clothing for when I was moving slowly.  Turns out
I also didn't want to switch my tunes from random songs to Speed 3,
because I was nervous about taking my iPod away from my body as well
as being nervous about taking my hands out of my gloves. So, my
intervals were especially poor.

Got to Alameda Open Space around 7:45.  Truck temperature claimed 34F,
I believe.  39F when I finished, I think.  I didn't write anything

decided to go out and run some more.  I only did one lap around AA
because I was concerned about the time.

Woke (from a dream) to my alarm at 5:15.  Not too surprising since I
didn't sleep well initially (presumably due to yesterday's beers),
waking up for a few minutes at a time at least through midnight.  So,
HR is post caffeine.

FWIW, I've gone back to 2 tablespoons of hemp seed instead of 4 in my
oatmeal.  4 was an experiment that I did due to having ordered such a
huge bag of hemp seed.
