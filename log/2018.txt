To anyone other than myself (or perhaps even to myself if I get even
more forgetful): this file is primarily intended for my own use.  As
such, there may be unstated pieces of information that could be useful
to anyone else.  Off the top of my head, here are a few things that
perhaps I should mention:

  I take a daily B-complex supplement, specifically Jarrow Formula's B-Right

  I used to take a daily multivitamin (that may not be vegan), specifically
  Kirkland's Signature Daily Multi, but stopped when the huge bottle ran
  out, sometime in early 2019, I believe.  On Friday, December 4th, 2020
  I started taking them again.  I'm not convinced they help, but I think
  there's a better chance that they help then that they hurt.

  I have a double espresso or more, pretty much at 5:15am every
  morning.  I make it the day before and if I get up before 5:15, I
  don't drink it until my 5:15 alarm goes off.  If I am awakened by my
  alarm, I grab it off my dresser and drink it.

  I drink water when I feel like it, which isn't very often when I'm
  not actually running.  I didn't record the water I drink but I did
  record everything else (other than my 5:15am double espresso, which
  I initially didn't log, but do now).  I now mostly record my water
  consumption, although most of my water comes from the food I eat
  since I typically prepare lentils and/or beans in two or three cups
  of water.

  Over time exactly what I've written down has changed slightly, in that
  now I'm logging my starting weight, which is how much I weigh after I've
  had my morning double espresso, pooped but before I've eaten anything or
  exercised.  I also log the nearby temperature and my resting heart rate.

  I typically exercise before I eat any calories, although I make an exception
  on Wednesdays (when I'm doing a pack run) and Saturdays when I do my "long"
  run.  I typically record how much I've run before I eat, but the general
  pattern from mid November through mid March is:

    Monday 13.1 miles (with interval work mixed in)
    Tuesday 8.9 miles
    Wednesday some distance (with a 40# pack)
    Thursday 8.9 miles
    Friday 13.1 miles
    Saturday either long flat pack run or 5 miles up the mountain and back
             down again with a pack
    Sunday bike ride, typically 35.5 miles, but more if Saturday was light
                      unless it's cold enough for there to be ice or I'm
                      exercising with Team RWB.  So, I really don't ride
                      my bike much during these months

  I have extensive stats on my exercising that are not part of this file

  I do core exercises twice a week, which consists of at least
  100 sit-ups, at least 100 push-ups and 100 unweighted squats.  I
  break the sit-ups and push-ups into currently two sets, and am
  slowly increasing the number in the first two sets with the idea of
  eventually getting to 2 sets of 50, then possibly moving to a longer
  set followed by a shorter set.  Over the years I tend to build up my
  core to where I'm doing > 50 sit-ups in the first set and > 50
  push-ups in the first set, but then something causes me to slack off
  and I have to drop way back.  My body really doesn't want to keep
  much non-leg muscle on, unless I'm consistent.
    
As far as I can tell, I'm the healthiest of the five of us in my
nuclear family (the other four being my wife, my son (born in 2002)
and my twin daughters (born in 2004).  I base that on my perception of
how often we get sick, who gets sick first and how long people remain
sick, but I do not have objective measurements of any of that.  I do
appear to be pretty healthy though.

My goal had been to get my body fat percentage down to 7.3%.  I had my
third hydrostatic weighing on Thursday, July 26th, 2018.  That gave me
an idea of how much more I needed to lose.  I had been monitoring my
performance in my daily runs to make sure my weight loss is not
interfering with my performance.  My weight loss *was* interfering with
my ability to get stuff done from about 6pm to 8pm.  I mostly lost
motivation then.  I expect my motivation to return when I'm no longer
stressing my body by running a calorie deficit.

The above paragraph doesn't really say much about what happened
between mid 2018 and now (December 9th, 2020), but it's been
interesting and informative.  I typically play a poker tournament at
6:05 Mountain time and if I'm cutting weight my body prioritizes my
morning and evening and slows down significantly in between which is
not optimal for writing code.  Luckily, I'm not currently cutting
weight, but when I hit that cylcle in my training again I'll have to
watch how it affects my work.  Most likely I'll have to forego the
daily poker tournament.

Initially I was going to try to calculate my calorie intake and my calorie
expenditure, but I decided that it's better to simply estimate my calorie
intake and compare similar days to previous similar days and try to do what
has worked before or make adjustments to what hasn't worked.

FWIW, when I started doing this I thought it would be hard to lose
weight because so many people have trouble with it.  It was easy for
me to lose weight, although perhaps I lost too much muscle in the
early days.  Since I haven't yet had my third hydrostatic weighing I
don't know for sure that I've increased the percentage of my weight loss
which was fat burned, but I think I have.  I'll know soon.

I wrote this preamble on Tuesday, July 24th, 2018, long after I
started this log, although I've tweaked it slightly on Monday, June
3rd, 2019.  I recently updated it on December 9th, 2020, but I did so
very quickly and there's not guarantee it's particularly accurate.

I mention products by name, just to be more specific.  I do not have
any sponsorships or any other form of compensation from anyone or any
entity.  Much of the food I eat comes from Costco, because it's
relatively inexpensive and high quality.

Saturday 20180331

533 normal oatmeal:
    160  1/3 cup Coaches Oats (steel cut oatmeal)
    113 2 tablespoons Nutriva hemp
    120 2 tablespoons Nutriva black chia
     80 Silk soy milk
     60 1/2 tablespoon Udos 3-6-9 Oil

322 large avocado

400 2x 200 calories tailwind

100 roctane gu

??? 2 large bowls of bean soup with rice

322 1 large avocado

 50 1 large orange

 50 1 medium orange

120 1 banana

 15 3 greek olives

 ?? green drink

  3 10 small pickles

1593 + whatever the bowls of bean soup with rice + green drink + rice milk

I also wasn't logging throughout the day and I may have forgotten something.
In theory I burned 3495 calories in 7 hours, 21 minutes and then there's
also my base calorie burn (1,734 calories / day)

If I calculated right, I burned 1,734 + 3495 - (7:21 / 24:00 * 1734) calories
or 4,698 calories today.  If so, then I'm probably running at least a 1,000
calorie deficit which is appropriate for 2 pounds / week.

Hmmm... a different base metabolic calculator figures I need 3,367.42 calories
to keep my typical activity level going without any weight change, but that
probably takes some of the 3,495 into consideration

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunday 20180401

Rode my bike 50 miles before having any calories.  I didn't write down
when I had eaten last, but my guess is I had an avocado yesterday evening
at about 7pm.  I started riding my bike about 7am and didn't finish until
a little before 10am

??? Had a green drink sometime

533 normal oatmeal (at about 10am):
    160  1/3 cup coaches oats
    113 2 tablespoons nutriva hemp
    120 2 tablespoons nutriva black chia
     80 silk soy mil
     60 1/2 tablespoon udos oil

Did I have rice milk?  I didn't write it down, but a week later I'm
suspecting I did, because I typically have rice milk after my bike
ride.  OTOH, we may have been out that day.

Lunch 12:06pm
400? bowl of bean soup with rice (not much rice) -- guessing at type and amount
300? 2nd bowl of bean soup without rice          -- of beans
480 handful of nuts (3 oz) -- In the future, I should probably only have
                              1 to 1.5 oz of nuts at a time
60? bowl of steamed cauliflower
120 medium banana (final lunch food @ 1:21pm)

Snack 3:30pm
200? handful of dates -- 23 calories per date, did I have 9?
120 medium banana
 50 small orange
 50 large orange

Dinner 5:32pm
444? bowl of quinoa -- 222 calories per cup, did I have 2 cups?
240 half brick of tempeh

Snack 6:20pm
480 handful of nuts -- I took these w/o thinking.  I probably should have
                       eaten something else, but I'm in the habit of eating
                       handfuls of nuts

Looks like all told I ate about 2,944 calories

1,734 + 1615 - (1,734 / 8) = 3,132 calories
If all of the above is correct, I probably *didn't* get a 1,000 calorie
deficit in part due to all the nuts.  OTOH, I'm not sure that I'm supposed
to subtract the BMR portion of the day

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monday 20180402 Starting weight 184

Back from my 13.1 mile run, 9:15am
600 normal oatmeal
 50? glass of rice milk

Sophie came back 10:00am?
 50? green drink

Lunch 11:35
675? about two cups yellow lentils (has some water and may not really be 2 cups)

Snack 1:20pm
40 6x small sweet pickles

600 4x vegan tamales
400 bowl of quinoa (Sophie added oil to it w/o realizing I didn't want oil)

snack 5:11
120 medium banana

snack 6:34
240 half brick of tempeh
 50 small orange
 50 large orange
 50? salad

TOTAL: approx. 2925

2915 calories burned 1,734 + 1352 - (1,734 * 142 / 1440)

However, I also did push-ups and sit-ups along the way

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuesday 20180403 Starting weight 183.5

Back from my 6.55 mile run, 7:45am

533 normal oatmeal
 50? glass of rice milk
 50? green drink

Lunch 11:42
 66 2 cups green beans
300 2x vegan tamales
373 1 cup yellow lentils (I actually measured out a cup, little water)

Snack 2:28 pm
120 medium banana

Dinner 4:30
250 cup of refried beans (Taco Shel)
250 cup of rice (Taco Shel)

Taco Tuesday beer 6:30
285? 8 oz. 13.75% ABV
167? 10 oz. 6.5% ABV

Salad 8:53
50?  small salad (no dressing)
50?  cucumber salad (I'll have to ask Sophie what was in it)
40 6x small sweet pickles

TOTAL: approx. 2,620
2381 calories burned 1,734 + 733 - (1,734 * 71 / 1440)

May not have run a deficit, but considering I had the equivalent of three
beers (over two hours) and came home and ate *something*, I don't appear
to have *gained* any weight and I feel pretty good the morning after (and
am looking forward to some speed work)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wednesday 20180404 Starting weight 183.5

I already know in advance that my snack is coming from the ARR free food
at 7pm, so I need to time things accordingly

Back from my 13.1 mile run (with intervals), 9:30am

488 normal oatmeal:
    160  1/3 cup coaches oats
    113 2 tablespoons nutriva hemp
    120 2 tablespoons nutriva black chia
     35 silk almond / coconut milk
     60 1/2 tablespoon udos oil

 50? glass of rice milk
 50? green drink
120 quarter brick of tempeh

Lunch 12:13
700? Yellow lentils that Sophie doctored up with chickpeas, spinach and red
     pepper.  The good thing is no oil was added, however, it's less protein
     dense and I really have no idea how many calories are in it.

     I'll add a salad and some pineapple and then plan on eating more
     tempeh for my snack, since today I ran 13.1 and I'm doing core

 75 cup of pineapple (raw, not in syrup) probably less than a cup
 50 small salad (darker greens than previous)

Snack ?2:47? -- forgot to write down the time
120 quarter brick of tempeh

dinner at 5pm
700? other bowl of doctored yellow lentils
 60? bowl of steamed cauliflower & broccoli
 50 small orange
 50 large orange
138 6 dates

snack 7pm ARR meeting
??? 2 pieces of broccoli with guacamole

Didn't try summing the calories from yesterday or estimating the
deficit, but I lost 1.5 pounds (see below).  Some of that may just be
due to random fluctuations with how much I pooped in the morning (a
lot!), but overall I think my estimates are so loose that it's not
worth the time for me to sum them up and estimate my deficit, *as long
as I carefully restrict myself and keep watching the numbers*.

Wednesday 20180418 Starting weight 175 (expect no loss or gain tomorrow)

I didn't plan on having three pints yesterday, but one of the Team RWB
members forgot that he was having surgery the next day and ordered a
Stella and then realized he couldn't drink it, so I had it, then I
ordered a stout, liked it and had another one.  I didn't eat after
coming home, nor did I drink anything.  As such, I may be partially
dehydrated, although it was also chilly last night--we left the
windows open--and perhaps my body burned even more fat than normal to
keep warm, although I did grab my sleeping bag around 3am.

Thursday 20180419 Starting weight 175.25

My quarter pound weight gain is not too surprising, since I had lost
two pounds in the prior day.  The two pound loss was probably
partially due to me having had three beers and no water as my last
thing consumed the evening prior, so yesterday morning's weight was
probably lower than normal due to lack of water.  I think my diet
yesterday was fine considering it was both a 13.1 w/intervals and a
core exercise day.

This was the Cedro Peak 50k.  I skipped breakfast and accidentally didn't
eat my avocado, because I never touched my Cedro Peak drop bag.  I had
prepared two avocados.  I should have eaten a bunch more at the aid
stations, but the potato chips weren't holding the guac well and I still
had olive left.

Thursday 20180426 Starting weight 171.5
I may have overcompensated for the beer by eating too lightly yesterday or
it could just be whatever source of randomness in weight fluctation just
happened to favor me today.

8.9 mile 31.5# pack run
First post-BMDM pack run.  Used my SAR pack w/o some standard stuff, 'cause
that's how it was packed and I didn't think it was too important to have 40#
seeing how my right ankle is still slightly swollen.  This is just to get
back into the swing of things (and also give me a little more exercise than
a normal Thursday, since I won't get my full exercise up at Philmont on
Saturday and might not get my full exercise on Sunday, either).

Breakfast @ 8:15 (roughly; forgot to write it down)
533  normal oatmeal (after 8.9 mile run)
 50? 16 oz. rice milk
 50? green drink

9:45 snack

20? small amount of peas & green beans left over from lunch
160 1 oz mixed unsalted nuts
130  medium banana

4:00 snack
 60 4 oz. pineapple (because it was there)

5:00 dinner
155? 2/3 cups brown lentils
500? more, but different lentils & matpe beans
300? avocado

6:00 beer
335? Petrus 16 oz. 8.5% ABV

NOTE: Friday, Saturday and Sunday are all even more inaccurate than
      normal due to me driving to and attending ESCAPE.  That
      prevented me from weighing myself at my normal time on Friday
      and at all on Saturday or Sunday (actually, I weighed myself
      when I got back on Sunday, but that was about 3:10pm, so I
      didn't record it).  ESCAPE had a nice menu for vegetarians and a
      fairly decent salad bar for vegans, but they didn't really
      appear to have many (any?) protein sources for vegans, so I ate
      seitan, tempeh and 2 dehydrated meals.  I also didn't exercise
      as much as normal, although I did do two 32# (estimated) pack
      runs.

      When I got back from ESCAPE, I had an Avery Beast Grand Cru and
      I think the bottle said it was 17.4% ABV (the ABV varies per year).
      That not only added a bunch of calories, but it also reduced my
      willpower and I ate some dates that I probably didn't need to
      eat (they were in a baggie; I took them "just in case").  I may
      have also eaten stuff I didn't write down.

      I suspect I didn't lose any weight at ESCAPE and I won't be too
      surprised (although I'll be disappointed) if I gained weight.

Monday 20180430 Starting weight 172.5

I gained a pound over the ESCAPE weekend instead of continuing with my
weight loss.  I suspected that would happen.  Oh well.  If I hadn't
had the beer when I got back I probably wouldn't have gained as much,
but I did eat well and got in some good (although a tiny amount) of
exercise while I was up at Philmont.

Breakfast @ 9:00

160  1 oz. mixed nuts (5g protein)

~130g protein.  I probably didn't need to eat the tempeh to get the
101 grams of protein _Racing Weight_ claims a vegan athlete of my
weight needs, however today was both 13.1 miles *with* intervals and
core exercise (100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups and 60 squats), so perhaps
having some extra isn't too bad.


Tuesday 20180501 Starting weight 170

250? 16 oz 6%? ABV Chocolate Porter

Wednesday 20180502 Starting weight 170

Not too surprising that I didn't lose weight after a seemingly 2.5
pound loss the previous day.  However, I didn't gain any, even though
I had around 800 calories of beer last night.

Breakfast @ 9:00
533  normal oatmeal (after 13.1 mile run)

160  1 oz. mixed nuts

7pm Snack
150 pretzel with hummus
 30 5x pringles

Thursday 20180503 Starting weight 171

Should have skipped the tamales since they were largely empty
calories.  Should have had less pineapple and strawberries, since
they're high in sugar. Should have skipped the 7pm snack, although
normally they have veggies.  Taking a step backward is annoying,
especially since I didn't feel particularly hungry much of yesterday,
so my eating was based more on "I can do this within my calorie count"
rather than "I need to eat something because my hunger is distracting"

     Sophie had already mixed the rice and beans.  It was about a 1 1/4 cup.
     There was maybe 3/4 cup  of steamed broccoli, squash and zucchini.
     I was hungry, so I threw the remaining veggies and topped it off with
     black beans and added a lot of the black bean broth.  I don't have a
     good feel for how many calories were in it, but I normally eat at 5
     and was exceedingly hungry.

150? 3/4 cup remaining black beans
240  3x Cara Cara orange

Elevation Insanity

We started hiking at 12:00:01 am.  I did not have any food after
dinner and before I got to the truck after the first ascent, which was
approximately 4:45am.  That's when I had my first caffeine.  I did not
write down what I ate and when, but I know that I consumed roughly the
following.  I brought "emergency" gels and Tailwind but never used
them.

We only made 5 ascents, but we were on our feet pretty much from the
start until approx. 8pm (20 hours), although we got a little time to
sit waiting for the tram and driving to trailheads.  We were actually
doing hikes for 15:51:24 and went approximately 33.83 miles, climbing
approximately 20,698 ft.

Sunday 20180506 Starting weight unknown (was in hurry to get to the zoo)

Run for the Zoo half marathon

I got up at my regular 5:15 and decided to see if I could get to the
zoo early enough to register for RftZ 1/2.  I didn't have any food
before.  Afterward I wound up eating leftover food from Elevation
Insanity, including the following.  I did not keep track of when I ate
or *exactly* what I ate (especially the dates and nuts).  I don't
think I ate anything but the popsicles, keva juice and beer other than
Elevation Insanity leftovers until dinner.

4 popsicles
3 tiny platic cups of keva juice

Tuesday 20180508 Starting weight 168.0

No loss and maybe a tiny gain, but that's not too surprising after
such a big loss, especially with eating the mystery calorie pizza and
only running half my normal Monday distance.  The next two weeks will
be tricky since I'm on my taper.

Not quite down to 167.75, but definitely a little under 168.0.
Tonight is RubiABQ, so that may make further losses difficult.  OTOH,
this morning is a 36# pack run, so we'll see.  My pack is only 36
pounds because I'm using my SAR pack (w/o the water bladder) exactly
as it is currently configured.  I'll resume training with my Kelty
pack after I get it kitted up with food (or weights!).

Thursday 20180510 Starting weight 167.5

1:00 Breakfast after running 4.45 mi
Breakfast was late because we had a SAR mission that had us drive up north
of Santa Fe, then turn around.  I chose not to eat anything before going on
my taper 4.45 mile run.

533  normal oatmeal (after 5.55 mile 36.5# pack run)

Friday 20180511 Starting weight 167.75

Beer with food was probably what did me in.  That SAR mission certainly
threw off my schedule.  There's a chance that by eating so late my weight
is up simply because not everything I ate yesterday has passed through me,
but for now I'll simply assume I had too many calories, especially since I
am on my taper.  Speaking of which, today I start my 1/4 distance taper,
so I need even fewer calories...

7:00 Breakfast (after 3.22 mile run: 1/4 distance taper)

FWIW, my plan is to not drop any more weight between now and Thursday morning,
which will be the last day I have access to our home scales before I get back
on Monday.  I am not going to fret if I lose a little or even gain a little
during this time or after Cruel Jewel.  I'm going to wait until after I feel
stable after CJ100 before I resume losing.

650? normal oatmeal (after 4 mile run with 3x 75 second all-out intervals)
     I had made some oatmeal prior to a SAR mission and it was in the fridge.
     I started eating it, but it had a bit of a sour taste.  Eventually I
     threw what was remaining out and made a new bowl, but as I was pouring
     on the soy milk, it was all bubbly and smelled funny.  I tried a forkful
     or two and it was sour, so I threw that out and made another bowl, this
     time with Sophie's almond & coconut (still unsweetened) milk.  So that
     third bowl was less than 533 calories (because the almond and coconut
     milk has less calories than the soy), but I don't know how much I ate
     of the other bowls, which is why I have 650 with a question mark.

Wow. I was just trying not to lose any weight and I went overboard and
gained a pound and a quarter.  Oh well.  Live and learn.  Part of that
is that I only ran 4 miles yesterday rather than my usual Monday 13.1.
That's roughly a 900 calorie change right there.

Looks like the refrigerator probaby was left open overnight, because
three packages of seitan with a "Best Used Before June 19th" label are
all puffed up.  *Perhaps* that's why I got so bloated last night (and
am still bloated); I had attributed it to the 8 cups of beans I had.

food in the gut.  Oh well.

8:15 am (Mountain time) huge snack
Because we had to change planes, I got concerned with my lack of calories, so
I took out a huge bag of nuts and ate about half of them.  I never weighed
the bags, so even if I ate exactly half (and I didn't even try to measure
that), I still wouldn't know how much I ate.

avocado (I took two), pickles and often a handful of skittles and
a stack of Lays version of Pringles.  One aid station had hummus avocado
pinwheels (i.e. wrapped in a flour tortilla).  I ate all they had (they
said they could make more, so I wasn't shorting anyone else).

Hadn't planned on losing weight while I still have this cold, however I
don't think I understand the weight gain and loss associated with CJ100.
I'm not unhappy that I'm back down again.  I'm just surprised.  I still
have enough of a cold that I won't be drinking any beer today, even though
it's Thursday.

Not surprising that I gained weight with all that eating yesterday.
However, I got rid of the nut butter and the extra food may have helped me
recover quicker from the Crest Trail hike, although since I had the leak
in my 2.5 gallon water brick, that wasn't as taxing as it could have been.

drink beer that often...

morning's run and set a PR for 13.1 miles @ 130bpm: 2:15:47 (10:21 min/mile)
although that could have been due to my pre-workout and during workout

Saturday 20180609 Starting weight 165

Due to pigging out yesterday I was overweight, but in theory that would give
me plenty of energy during the Chimney Melon 50k. In reality I wound up with
some cramps that seemed to keep me walking even after I escaped the heat in
the second half of the second loop.

I did not write down what I ate until two days later, but it was
something like:

5:15 breakfast
533 normal oatmeal (25g protein)

during loop 1
3 tablespoons of chia (in water) before the tram
a bunch of mixed nuts
3 tablespoons of chia (in water) after the tram
more mixed nuts

at the truck
one large avocado
24 oz. rice milk
more nuts

during loop 2
3 tablespoons of chia (in water) before the tram
a bunch of mixed nuts
3 tablespoons of chia (in water) after the tram
more mixed nuts

at the truck again
16 oz. rice milk

back at the house
533 normal oatmeal (25g protein)

FWIW, I had made two containers of oatmeal, but forgot to put them in
the cooler, so I wasn't able to eat oatmeal at the truck between loops
1 and 2.

Sunday 20180610 Starting weight 158.5

I got called to a search and rescue mission, so that interfered with my
food logging.

I got called right before I left to go biking.

At the incident base I had a bunch of nuts and eventually my fortified
oatmeal

When I got back, noon was approaching and I had 3 tablespoons of chia
in my water while I did my core exercises

After my core exercises I had (although some of this may have been after lunch)
12 oz. Avery Beast
12 oz. Rochefort 10

Lunch was watery beans, a ton of broccoli, a small salad and maybe more

my dinner was very watery beans with some quinoa and maybe more

I ate at least three oranges after Sophie came back from Costco:
at least one soon after she came back and two right after dinner

Monday 20180611 Starting weight 161

So, I lost 1.75 pounds in the last week and definitely had more chia
while exercising.  Does the smaller weight loss and the increased
protein from chia mean that my loss was a higher percentage of fat
than previously?  I won't know for another five or more weeks, and we
have the family trip between now and then, so it'll still be hard to
tell, but I think it's a good start.

I should have kept track of what I ate during yesterday.  One thing
that I might want to do is pre-package a bunch of 1 oz. mixed nuts
since sandwich baggies are so light.

Surprising gain, seeing how I thought I ate basically what I ate a week
prior.  I'm guessing I underestimated the calorie content of the northern
beans.  There were also some veggies thrown in and perhaps other stuff.
My portions were also on the big side of things.

Today will be tricky, since it's Taco Tuesday.  OTOH, since I only run
8.9 miles and I'm not doing core, I don't need to eat much between now
and then.

Yipes.  I ate way too much yesterday to combat the perceived effort of
doing trail building.  I'm sure a bunch of that weight will disappear by
tomorrow, but it still may be hard to get much further below my Saturday
weight by the time I go for hydrostatic weighing on Thursday.  Oh well.
At least I have my power (I think; I'll know more after my bike ride)

FWIW, I did indeed have my power and managed to ride 35.5 miles in 1:54:25
at a 130bpm avg HR, for an average of 18.6 mph.  That's better than I've done
in the last two years and although it wasn't *hot*, it wasn't cool either.

Monday 20180723 Starting weight 156.00, 50 bpm, 80F

As a test, I wore my HRM for about 12 minutes while in bed with the
lights off from 5:03 to 5:15 before I had my daily double espresso.
The average, once I settled down was 49, the lowest was 46.  There was
a three minute span whose average was 48.

By contrast, the 50bpm in the Starting weight line was taken the way I
normally take my resting HR, which is after I've had my double
espresso and made Sophie's cappuccino and my cereal.  I put my HRM on
and lie back in the La-Z-Boy chair and actively try to calm down and
see the lowest reading I can get the HRM to drop to.  I typically
spend a few minutes waiting for it to settle and then when it gets
almost as low as it will get, I hold my breath and it drops a point or
two and I record that.  Realistically, I think that gets me pretty
close, but it looks like it's two BPM or so high, since I think the
three minute span of 48 best represents a true resting HR, although it
took 12 minutes to find it.

Just like my weights here are always (when I'm in town, at least)
weighed on the same scale and I know that the scale weighs about 2.2
pounds high at my weight, I'm happy to have a consistent way of
measuring my resting HR, and I'll continue to use that method although
I may experiment more with wearing my HRM overnight.

FTR, the temperature is what Wunderground lists for the Heritage Hills
Station that is closest to my house.  I record it at the same time I
record my bpm, which is fairly soon before I leave for my morning run.
My Ambit 3 has a thermometer in it, so my Movescount tracking also has
a temperature range, but the watch's temperature is affected by my own
body heat to some extent, so although I think it's useful to compare
Movescount recorded temperatures between each other, I don't think
they're as accurate as what I get from Wunderground, at least when
I'm near the station involved.

Tuesday 20180724 Starting weight 153.50, 45 bpm, 66F

FWIW, I put on my HRM for a half hour starting at 4:33, figuring I'd
get back to sleep, but I didn't. My average HR for that time was 53,
although it includes a few minutes when I went to the bathroom and my
HR jumped while I was up.  There was a two minute forty seven second
span of an avg HR of 47 in there, so I think 47 would be an
appropriate HR, but using my standard way of measuring after my double
espresso today gave me 45bpm, 2bpm lower, which is funny because
yesterday that method read 2bpm higher, so perhaps it's an acceptable
approximation after all.

I wore my HRM from 03:28 to 05:15 and there was 30 minute span where
my average HR was 48, so I think that suggests that the quick way I'm
calculating (which got me 47 today) is close enough that I don't need
to futz with wearing my HRM in bed anymore.

Saturday 20180728 Starting weight 153.00, 49 bpm, 59F

I couldn't get back to sleep after 2:30, so I got up at 3:30 (alarm
was set at 3:55) and took my double espresso.  The scale is really
reading between 152.75 and 153.00 and my guess is if I had gotten up
at my usual time and weighed myself it would read 152.75 or lower due
to peeing and pooping more.

Ugh.  Didn't get a chance to record calories because I was planning on
counting the remainder of what I brought and using that.  However, I got
called on a SAR mission Sunday morning and wound up using a bunch of
the remainder (and not keeping track of that, either!).

I basically had a full oatmeal before the run, then ate approximately
1,000 calories of nuts and 480 calories of dates and 1,650 calories of
chia and Tailwind on the way to Canyon Estates and then at the
turnaround ate maybe 50 calories of watermelon, 210 of peaches, 100?
of oatmeal, and 70? of rice milk. On the way back I had approximately
1,650 calories of chia and Tailwind, 500? of nuts, 400 of dates.  At
finish I had 70? of rice milk and 100? of oatmeal.  Before bed I had 120
of banana.

Sunday 20180729 Starting weight 151.50, ?? bpm, 66F

Never got bpm.  Got called on SAR mission before I had a chance to measure
it.  I took a bunch of my leftover calories from yesterday with me and also
made myself a brand new oatmeal.  I had some oatmeal in the fridge which I
sampled and then had some of (I think; it might still be in the cooler). I
ate a pear and a banana (I think) on the way up.  I ate two more bananas after
the mission.  I ate a bunch of nuts, perhaps 1,000 calories.  When I got
back, I drank a 12 oz. 14%? ABV Samichlaus beer.

Had lunch, but didn't log it.  I think it was something like 3 cups of
lentils, 2 oranges, a big thing of cauliflower and broccoli, a vegan pizza
crust (just the crust) and some pickles

Monday 20180730 Starting weight 153.50, 53 bpm, 71F

HR was high probably because I had a second double espresso, mostly
just for kicks, but because I might be up a little late playing poker
tonight.  OTOH, having it this early may just make me crash that much
harder.  OTOOH, I'm up two pounds due to my SAR eating (w/o SAR
workout) yesterday so I'm skipping my chia during my interval and am
curious as to how fast I'll run having had extra caffeine today and
extra food and a more or less rest day yesterday.

Using different scale, so I adjusted my weight to what it would read if
we were at home.  Huge (1.5 pound) gain due to drinking and eating nuts
after.  Forgot to write my bpm down at the time. It was surprisingly high,
probably due to the drinking. Definitely started with a 5.

Friday 20180803 Starting weight 155.1 (scale says 152.9),  54 bpm, 81F

Didn't spend much time letting HR settle.  Like my other HR readings in
Las Vegas, this one was taken on the toilet, rather than lieing back on
my La-Z-Boy.

UGH! Didn't record the calories because I was traveling.  I
opportunistically ate a bunch of fruit to get rid of it.  I believe I
had one modified oatmeal that I made before packing the slow cooker.
I ate at least a brick of tempeh.  I ate the remainder of the nuts and
dates I had brought with me.  When I got back home, I think I ate
other stuff, but I could be mistaken.  I'm pretty sure I didn't have
any alcohol to drink.

Saturday 20180804 Starting weight 152.5 / 150.5, 51 bpm, 49F (Santa Fe, Ski)

IIRC, my bpm was 46 sitting on the can in the outhouse.  FWIW, I didn't
record my calories until the next day and so all the info here are just
estimates

Thursday 20180809 Starting weight 151.75 / 149.4, 50 bpm, 63F

Had two double espressos this morning instead of one.  I did so
because I had put extra beans in the coffee grinder and then thought,
well, why not?  That may have lead to a higher HR than I'd have
otherwise.

Yesterday, after getting bad readings on the HRM during my pack run, I
took out the battery and put it in our battery tester and sure enough,
it read low, so I put in a replacement battery.  I had only been using
that battery about two weeks (they usually last several months), but
it was a Sunbeam battery of unknown provenance from a desk drawer and
its replacement is the twin from the same two pack, so I'm guessing
I'll need to change the battery again soon.  I should probably do so
before Leadville, although I don't know how much *MY* HR will matter
when I'm pacing.

Weird weight difference today, but I was in a hurry to get out the door.
I didn't get on the big balance scale until after my tiny pack run (2.21
miles, 40#), but I did get on the electronic one before and after and both
times it read 151.2.  This was before I took a leak after coming back.

After the above, I lost track of what I was eating.  My plan was to not
restrict myself, so I ate some of Marcia's food (vegan lasagna, quinoa) as
well as a ton of fruit, two avocados.  Earlier, during the mandatory briefing
I ate a block of tempeh (although the block may have been a different size
than the blocks I've eaten previously).  I also ate a bunch of Peter's
roasted almonds.  I did not have any of my lentils or beans or any more beer,
at least at the time I'm writing this (2:21pm).

I finished the bananas (four? six?), didn't have any apples or pears,
ate a pluot or two.  I ate a nectarine or two, three or four peaches.



Saturday 20180818 Starting weight 15?.?? / 153.0, ?? bpm, 44F (Leadville)

Not surprising that I gained so much weight.  Assuming this guarantees
that my glycogen stores are topped up, I'm OK with it.  I expect I'll
lose a bunch as I pace Jeff today, although the post race drinking
will probably mean I don't lose very much and so I'll still have a bit
of a hole to climb out of.

Sunday 20180819 Starting weight 15?.?? / 1??.?, ?? bpm, ??F (Leadville)

I was out pacing Jeff on the Leadville Trail 100 race, so I didn't get a
chance to get any measurements, but the water froze at our campsite, so
it was probably < 32F where I would have measured it.

Ate a bunch of crap while pacing, starting with a bunch of potato chips
at the Winfield station before leaving.  I had to poop outside twice and
in a porta potty at least once (probably more than that)

Monday 20180820 Starting weight ??? / 156.5, 54 bpm, 34F (Leadville)

Not too surprising after all the drinking and being completely off my diet
for a few days.  Disappointing.

Started the day with "normal" (fortified with the usual ingredients)
oatmeal I had made the day before and lots of espresso and coffee.

Got $12 of food at Whole Food, including kale, radish, carrot, 4
medium avocados, bananas.  Ate some of it at Whole Food including a half
a package of seitan.

After getting to Denver, drank a lot of different beer with Dave, then
went to an upscale place and had a big tofu dish along with half a
salad and half a thing of soup.  Came back and drank some more with
Lauren.  Right before going to bed I think I ate the rest of the seitan,
a sprig of kale and either some dates or some nuts.


Tuesday 20180821 Starting weight ??? / ???.?, ?? bpm, ??F (Denver)

Slept at Dave and Lauren's.  Didn't want to disturb anyone by getting my
scale out and didn't think to check the temperature.  However, I also didn't
run, so the temperature is pretty irrelevant.

Did not log my food intake, but it was fairly large, eating a bunch of
stuff I had bought at Whole Food the day before as well as a lunch
serving of 4 cups (two full bowls) of red beans and a dinner serving
of the same size (finishing up the beans).  Additionally, I ate
radishes (and their greens), a carrot or two a bunch of pears, at
least 4 oz. mixed nuts (probably closer to 6 or 8), some kale and a
whole bunch (5? 6?) of bananas.  At home I had an Avery sour ale aged
in tequila barrels (meh) and an Ayinger Celebrator.  Had two or three
avocados, too.

Wednesday 20180822 Starting weight 156.0 / 154.2, 54 bpm, 66F (home)

Was raining when I got up, so I didn't do a pack run.  I took some

(mostly Monday and yesterday).

Revised my weight down from 153.9 to 152.7 after I had a 7am (local time)
poop.  My guess is fruit for dinner was a contributing factor.

Friday 20180907 Starting weight ??? / 155.5, 46 bpm, 54F (Homewood CA)

Eating a large pizza didn't help my weight loss, but it probably didn't
hurt my performance for a 200 miler.


Thursday 20180913 Starting weight 164 / 162.6, 47 bpm

Feet and legs still swollen from Tahoe 200.  Balance weight (164) is
from before I ate, but I forgot to record my electronic scale weight
when I took it before eatinmg, so the 162.6 is after oatmeal and green
drink.  Didn't record temperature, because I didn't exercise.

I'm assuming that in the next few days, I'll lose weight as the swelling
goes down.  However, my guess is I'll have still gained a bunch since I
went off my diet before Tahoe 200.  I thought I'd lose weight @ T200; I
didn't anticipate the severe swelling.

I probably shouldn't have gone off my diet quite so hard both before
and to some extent during T200.  I'm pleased with my T200 finish,
especially considering my having stubbed my toe hard on the second
day.  However, it looks like it might be a long time before I'm back
below 150.

ate a bunch of chips on field.  After coming back I more or less ate what
I'd normally eat, although I did have three bananas.  Still, I didn't record

It's a year later (i.e., I'm adding this note in 2019), and I remember
having beer after I got to tent city.  My *guess* is I had at least 3
and less than 6.  I know I didn't do the beer mile, because I haven't
done one ever.  It sounds like fun, but I'm certainly not going to do
it the day before I need a Western States Qualifier (like I did in
2018 and 2019).

It is very likely I had a double espresso at 4:15 and I know I was drinking
coffee from the Keurig machine, but I can't remember exactly which days I
had any; I wasn't really tracking caffeine well back then.

Freak Brothers Pizza

2 apples? (based on notes on what I took to JJ100)

            remaining nuts (ate these Friday night; may want to measure
                            in the future)

Saturday 20181027 I did not record anything in this file at the time, but
I had written (elsewhere):

  Second big takeaway: pay more attention to calories.  I consumed all
  20 of my bags of 2 tablespoons of chia with 2 scoops of tailwind, but
  I also ate like a piggy at many of the aid stations (including my four
  vegan brownies from The Cutting Board).  Consequentially I gained
  weight and I think I was a bit sluggish coming out of some of the aid
  stations.

FWIW, it was 34F when I started and 44F when I finished.  The sun was
up, but there was some haze. I expected full sunshine and rising
temperatures, so I wore shorts and a short-sleeve jersey, supplemented
by arm sleeves and fairly heavy bike gloves.  That was not enough,
because the haze actually increased and I rode relatively quickly.  As
such, I wound up cold enough to have mild hypothermia.  I couldn't use
my hands to get my waterbottle (that had 400 calories of Tailwind in
it) and I had to look at my hands when I put them on the brakes to be
sure I could engage the brakes properly.  My perception of distances
and times got warped and stayed warped even as I warmed up in my truck
on the drive home.  It was surreal.

I never consumed the 400 calories of Tailwind I had, nor did I choose
to drink the cold post-ride rice milk that I had.  I didn't record all
the times I ate mixed nuts, so today's calorie count is likely
inaccurate.

Temperature was at 5:30, but today I won't run until 11:30, since
today is the Black Friday Turkey Trots. HR is ridiculously high,
although I took it at 6:13, after having eaten breakfast. Normally I
take it either before my espresso (if I get out of bed on the early
side of 5:15) or after I've had my espresso but before I do my
exercise, much less have breakfast.  OTOH, I did have the equivalent
of six beers yesterday as well as two bowls of ridiculously sweet
fruit salad.

Jeff dropped by Anodyne last night, so Mike, Jeff and I rotated on the
table, letting the winner continue shooting.  So I was there later
than normal.  Once again I succumbed to hunger at the end.  Part of
that is lack of willpower, but part of it is knowing that I'm no
longer in my "loose weight" off-season.  OTOH, I gained enough during
the holidays that I really should lose some here and there.

Started running late due to a combination of being tired from last night,
wanting to see how much rain we got and having too much fun reading
Programming Rust.  Chose to do a second double espresso to get me moving.

NOTE: I did not record my lottery or mom's house calories at the time of
consumption and may have omitted some.  As it is, I didn't write down
the ABV of the beer I had and the Red Door Brewery website doesn't list
them.  There's also a chance that I had a fourth beer in there, since
I think my first wasn't one of the three listed, but I can't think of
what it was.  So ... I expect to have gained weight today.

HR taken 45 minutes after quad espresso, so is probably higher than if
I had taken it before the espresso or even closer to after consuming
it.  OTOH, my HR probably *is* still high due to the lingering chest
cold.  It's quite possible that had I skipped my hard run on Saturday
and Monday that I'd be 100% recovered by now, but I don't know that
and still think I did the right thing.

Took HR 35 minutes after quad espresso and wasn't patient, so it's higher than
if I had taken it early and taken my time.  I probably still have lingering
side effects from my cold and I probably also ran too hard yesterday to have
had a "normal" HR.

to me not having pooped a second time before eating my cereal.

Ugh. Didn't write much down.  I wound up drinking only about 1.5 of my 2
handhelds during my first run, not because I wasn't thirsty, but because
drinking with puffy mittens is tricky.

I wound up eating 3 servings of oatmeal today and also had 3 quad espressos.
At the Grinch Lunch I also ate a veggie burger with a side salad and had
3 pints of beer.  The first two didn't have an ABV posted with them, but
my guess is it was 6% or less.  The third (Monk's Trippel) was about 9.2%.

I also had a green drink, salad, medium bowl of steamed veggies.

At Marcia & Jeff's I had a Taddy Porter and some vegan Indian food.

When I got home, just slightly after 6pm, I had 3 oz. of mixed nuts
(480 calories) as my final calories.
