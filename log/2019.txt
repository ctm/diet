20 quad espresso (drank because it didn't fit conveniently in my vest; that

Did not consume any calories during my 3:05:51 run.  I didn't write down
anything after I got back from K&J until the following morning, so the rest
is off the top of my head

post-run consumed
some Rochefort 10 beer, some Scotia beer, some of Kelley & Joachin's beer,
a slice of vegan chocolate pie, my oatmeal, 24 oz. of rice milk, two vegan
burgers (one w/o bun, one w/ bun) some potato chips, pickles, probably more
that I can't think of

At home I had green drink, medium bowl of broccoli and cauliflower, beans
w/3 green chiles, 4 Cuties, at least 2 oz. mixed nuts, probably other calorie
sources

after 6pm I had chips and New Years Day salsa

Weight probably a pound high because I woke up to my alarm and hence
was running late.  As such, I weighed myself and ate my cereal before
my second poop.  HR is also a bit high since I took it after I had my
first quad espresso.  However, it probably would have been higher than
normal anyway, because 57 is awfully high even after a quad.

Saturday 20190511 weight unknown, HR unknown, 44F (I think) @ 00:01  (Cienega Trailhead)

Today was Elevation Insanity IX.  I did not take notes at the time.  I
also didn't write down exactly how many ounces of nuts and dates,
etc. I was taking with me, which meant that I couldn't just subtract
the amount I had left over.

As such, this is a rough approximation.

HR is high.  I don't remeember exactly when I got to sleep, but I may
have only gotten 7 hours of sleep or less.  OTOH, I may try changing
the HR strap battery soon.  FWIW, my HR was high yesterday when I took

Yesterday I had too much Tabasco and wound up awake in the middle of the
night again.  I'm thinking about cutting it out entirely, because I suspect
that in smaller amounts it's still interfering with my sleep a little, even
when I don't go fully awake.  I love spicy food, but I think I need to savor
it as a special treat, at least for a while, rather than trying to find a
small dose that I can have more regularly.

HR late and rushed

My run was supposed to be 15.5, but I chose to skip a loop for many reasons.
I don't know if I'll deliberately try to make up the extra 3.3, but I'll
probably go out again and walk the dog at least.

Saturday 20190928 weight 15?.? 50? bpm @ 5:0? > 32F @ 5:15 (Mt. Taylor)
did not know weight because did not take scale

5:15 wake-up
10 double espresso

5:30 Pre-race calories
533 fortified oatmeal
0 200 mg ibuprofen

6:15 pre-race caffeine
20 quad espresso

During the Mt Taylor 50k I chose to have a single 20 oz. handheld,
which I initially had loaded with 2 scoops of Tailwind and 2
tablespoons of chia.  I also had a baggie with another (2 scoops of
Tailwind and 2 tablespoons of chia) setup and a baggie with just 2
tablespoons of chia.  When I ran out of my first set of liquid, I got
water at an aid station and mixed up my baggie that had Tailwind, then
for the rest of the race I always put aid-station-provided Tailwind in
my bottle, except at the 1/2 way point where I had already mixed 2
scoops of my own with 2 tablespoons of chia and water.  I *meant* to
take more baggies of just 2 tablespoons of chia, but I got flustered
at the aid station and forgot to grab them and also forgot initially
to take my quad espresso.

I had too much emergency gear in my 1/2 way drop bag.  I should have
stripped it, especially since I also had access to my finisher's bag.
I need to always have a printed list of the things I need to switch
out; it only takes a few seconds to read such a list.

BTW, taking all that espresso, ibuprofen and chocolate left my stomach
slightly sore, but I don't think that really held me back.  I think a
combination of injury and still not being 100% recovered from Big
Cottonwood held me back much more.  I also knew Eric Pope was gunning
for the 56 year old record and I knew I didn't have it in me to beat
him, so I took my foot off the gas and had a great day.

Although I wrote down some of the calorie sources I was bringing with
me, I didn't write down what I ate post race until the following day.

during race

0 2x 200 mg ibuprofen (08:00? & 010:30?)

51.4F 20 minutes after (forgot to record it)

Today was an experiment, in that on the Tuesday after DCM and before
JJ100 last year, I ran my 8.9 miles much later in the day and after a
bunch of calories.  I started later after a false start where I
returned very early due to lightning.

Today, to some extent I tried to eat similarly (although last time
there were homemade calzones) and ran at 8:40 to see just how quickly
I can run my standard 8.9 mile (to Albuquerque Academy, two loops
around, and back) Tuesday run at 130bpm.  It wouldn't have been a fair
comparison due to differences in temperature, humidity and wind
anyway, but I was getting some pretty heavy HR swings that makes me
think I can't trust the numbers at all.

FWIW, I *felt* great.  If I had known that I wouldn't trust the HR
results, I would have just chosen a pace around 9 minutes a mile and
held on to it to see if I could do that with the same feeling as a
130bpm HR.  Oh well.  I can do interval training tomorrow and then
compare my non-HR interval stats with those from interval training
yesterday and figure out if yesterday's and today's trainings were net
*short term* wins (I'm sure they were worthwhile overall).

4:15 MST wake-up
10 double espresso

Did not bring a scale, but between my drinking and eating yesterday, I
assume I'm up three or four pounds.  I shouldn't have eaten a single
piece of candy, but rather than wallow in self-pity for my lack of
willpower, I'll remember that it really did taste good at the time and
I won't be doing it again (in a while!), so I'll own it as a happy
memory.

HR was after caffeine, although I did take a rushed reading before
that was higher (50bpm).  I don't actually think that the caffeine
lowered my HR.  I think that a combination of worse sleep due to
alcohol and heat combined with a different sleeping location prevented
me from waking up with a low HR.  Maybe next year I should make it a
point to see how low I can get my HR, although this year is 2 bpm
lower than last year.

I didn't bring Udo's 3-6-9 with me, too messy, so I bought a half
dozen avocados @ Bashas along with a bunch of the other veggies and
fruit.  I ate some veggies and fruit yesterday and will eat the rest
when I get back from JJ100.  I'm doing a jalf-assed low-fiber protocol
today; that *may* be a bad idea since it typically causes minor
problems the "day after" a marathon, which could happen during JJ100.
FWIW, I've never actually summed the amount of fiber I have on a
normal day, so I don't (yet?) have a feel for how getting my fat from
avocados rather than oil changes things.

FWIW, I completely screwed up my nutrition in a few ways: first, by pre-mixing
my water w/ chia seeds and Tailwind, it started to ferment or spoil and didn't
taste good at all, so it didn't really seem like I was taking in calories, even
though I did drinkk most of  it.  However, I also mixed up my drop-bags and
then over-corrected by bringing my 3 remaining baggies (I only had 17 bottles
with me, so I couldn't mix all 20 baggies) down from Jackass Junction (where
they were needed!) to JQ.  So then I tried to split up my bottles by only
drinking one mixture on the way to JJunction, so I'd have the other on my
way down, but that led me to binge eat other foods.  Ugh!

Oh, and doing a low fiber protocol the day before was *probably*
counter productive

FWIW, I think all the carbs I ate this morning was a bad idea.  I
should have *at most* had a normal cereal first thing after pooping,
although perhaps 2 or 3 slices of bread earlier but no tortillas or
gels would have been worthwhile.

I definitely should have checked my bite valve before starting because
running out of water was annoying, although it occurred after I had
done my intervals.

I decided not to run today.  My quad espresso never really woke me up
and various other minor things contributed to me not getting out the
door.  In fact, I basically had a down day and didn't do any
significant coding, either.  The Bosque Boogie beat me up a fair
amount due to all the slipping and sliding.  That winds up using
muscles in ways that a normal 50k doesn't use.

I did two runs today because I had to have routine maintenance done on
my truck, so I drove it down to Affordable Automotive, then ran back
home, tacking on an AA loop to get my run up to slightly more than 6
miles.  Then, when it was ready, I ran back down.

I didn't steam my cruciferous veggies when I normally do, due to my
run, so today's morning exercise and calories were a little different
from a normal Tuesday's, but not by much.

tamales and sweet potato were probably a lot more carbs than normal
*maybe* that will give me more oomph when doing my pack run today,
although I'm going to do it w/o morning pre-run calories

FWIW, I may have had the oomph, but it was relatively warm, albeit the
high humidity helped it feel slightly cooler.  I did not run with my
ice hat, but I  probably should have

Monday 20191209 weight 15?.? ?? @ ?:?? 30F @ 1:00 (top of crest, car thermometer)

I got called out on a search-and-rescue mission at about 11:30 Sunday
night.  I got out the door at about midnight and got to the top of the
crest just slightly after 1am.  I could not get the Sienna to the
parking spaces at the top, but Jesse helped me at least get the
Sienna to a safe place out of the way.

I was a useful member of team one, although Jesse and Bill led the
way, with Jesse doing trail finding.  The subject was a little below
the stairs on the Crest Trail Spur.  We went down in our snowshoes,
but should have used micro-spikes instead.

I mostly carried stuff, then, after the subject was safely in an
ambulance, I misplaced my keys and wound up going back (by that time
it was daylight) to look for them.  It's a bit of a long story, but I
was convinced my keys were with my phone and they weren't.  My phone
had slid off the console presumably when the Sienna was slipping and
sliding up at the top and out of sight is out of mind, so my keys were
in a baggie by themselves and I later repurposed that baggie to hold
various Jet Boil parts because I didn't have time or finger
coordination to get the Jet Boil back into a cohesive unit (and the
baggie that normally held the Jet Boil had been repurposed).

Anyway, I wound up eating 3 gels while the subjeft was being attended
to, not because I needed calories, per-se, but because I let my
fingers get very cold (because I had switched to my very warm, but
totally awkward mittens, but that meant I had to take my hands out of
the mittens completely to do a bunch of tasks, including repeatedly
handling the subject's completely frozen pants and shoes that I had
volunteered to schlep about.

Altuough I was wearing my Ambit 3, I must have either accidentally
turned it off when I thought I was locking the controls or turned it
off when getting into my pack and then forgot to lock it (or perhaps I
locied it after turning it off).  So, my exercise log has guesses for
that activity.  Normally I don't write down much detail in this file
for SAR missions because my saved exercise data reminds me what I
did...

FWIW, the subject was taken to the firehouse down the mountain and I
had to go there to retrieve some of the clothing I had lent him.  So I
got to see that he did not get any frostbite.  He still had some
tingling in his toes, but he could feel all of them which was *MUCH*
better than when we found him.  Yay!

I didn't have a quad espresso because I'm feeling a bit sick and was
leaning toward not doing today's pack run.  Elvis had a 102 fever and
was sent home from school yesterday.  Iris didn't go to school
yesterday.  I have a small amount of stuff in my lungs and may have
had a fever a couple of days ago.  However, I did my fiber protocol
yesterday and the weather is good.  Tomorrow's CiSAR litter evaluation
is easy, so I'll do today's pack run and just expect it to go poorly
but to get it over with.

Still sick.  HR was after caffeine, because I woke up to my alarm
rather than my own.  I did not sleep through the night due to fever,
so I reluctantly had an ibuprofen and stayed awake for about a half
hour afterward.  I'm definitely feeling much better and may suit up
and run a small amount today, but only after the sun is shining.

If I run today, it'll be 3 miles at the Grinch Lunch at 11:30.  My
plan had been to do a La Luz pack run before hand, but I'm still
getting over the flu.  I don't feel like I have much junk in my lungs,
but I did need an aspirin last night to mitigate body aches that were
preventing me from sleeping.  I also had minor GI distress this
morning.

I took 200mg ibuprofen after being called on a search and rescue
mission in the mountains.  I have minor body aches lingering from the
flu.  They actually interfered with my sleep last night, but I was too
stubborn to take anything for them.  I was planning on not taking
anything today, but I didn't want to be unduly uncomfortable on the
mission.  However, the road to the top was horrendous and they already
had people on their way, so our team was asked to stand down.  IOW, if
I had waited until I was closer to incident base, I wouldn't have
taken it, *BUT* it takes a little while to kick in, so I don't regret
that I did.
