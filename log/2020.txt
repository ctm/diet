I screwed up and accidentally cut about 2 miles of the course on the
lower half.  I sort of made up for it, I think, by running some extra
distance east up toward the mountans before having to head back west
again.  However, when I was trying to use my Ambit 3 to navigate (I
should have used my phone!)  I accidentally stopped and then erased my
earlier tracks.  I think I was around 16 miles when that happened.  I
started tracks again and logged 13.95 miles, finishing just a little
before 3pm (i.e. just under seven hours).

FWIW, my post-flu junk in lungs really got to me as did body-aches
which is why I took 200 mg of ibuprofen.

Chose to run 5.6 instead of 13.1 so I'll have more oomph for my 21
mile pack run tomorrow.  Last year I didn't run at all (due to rain)
the day before the equivalent run and I did very well and largely
adopted a no Friday runs policy for the rest of my BMDM training.  So,
I considered not running at all, but there was new snow on the ground
and I also have been running erratically due to the long tail of the
flu, so I decided to do 5.6 and see how tomorrow goes.

Similarly, instead of doing a low-fiber protocol today, I'm doing a
medium fiber, which allows me to have what I consider my optimal
recovery food (oatmeal) early, but switches to spaghetti for the bulk
of my calories.

medium-fiber experiment:
533 normal morning cereal
50? green drink
 50? 16 oz. rice milk

no beans
no lentils
no fruit

FWIW, I took no ibuprofen before or during today's pack run.  It was
cold enough that I started with a light long-sleeve (Boston Marathon)
shirt under my Team RWB T-shirt, JJ100 arm warmers, fleece hat and
hand warmers in my gloves.  At the turnaround stopped, took off my
pack, took off my shirts, put my T-shirt back on and stuffed the
long-sleeve shirt, the armwarmers and hat into my pack.  I also had my
3rd quad espresso of the day then.  Due to cold hands, that stop took
me 6 minutes.  I also walked four minutes at one pont (about 18 miles
in) while I stuffed my gloves and hand warmers into my side pockets
and filled one of my hand-helds from my bladder.

So, I think I lost ten or more seconds per mile dealing with the cold.
I also may have lost some time due to being over dressed.  At 20F, I
probably shouldn't have had that long-sleeve shirt on underneath.
OTOH, my toes already had some suspicious blisters that could have
been from frost-nip earlier in the week and today was a bit of an
experiment.

I did remember to use my North Face water bottle rather than my other
UD bottle (the one with the broken strap), but I really do need a new
handheld with a strap that I can adjust.  The NF bottle's strap is a
bit tight when I have a handwarmer in a glove on the hand that is
using that bottle and too tight of a strap then cuts into my
circulation, exacerbating the cold.

Unlike my previous bosque runs, I didn't need to stop to pee or poop.
The lack of peeing may have been due to all the sweating I did with
the extra layers.  The lack of pooping may have been due to my medium
fiber protocol yesterday.  OTOH, both might simply be due to me being
much less under the influence of the flu than previously.

Did not poop before I started doing my core exercises, just like two
days ago.  However, unlike then, the exercise didn't get me going, so
I had about 3/4 of my green drink before my 3rd set of sit-ups.  I did
poop about ten minutes after finishing my core, so I weighed myself
then, but one could argue that my weight today is about 12 oz. too
high.

I was supposed to have a quad espresso when I woke up, which is either
one full Hammer gel flask, or two half full flasks.  However, I had
filled all three of my flasks, so I had six double espressos
available, with the idea that I'd have two today and then have two on
standby for tomorrow.  But when I woke up this morning, I forgot that
I had done that, but I did remember that I was going to do a pack
speed run today, so I drank two full flasks w/o thinking about it.
Then I wound up drinking my third flask before going running.

I don't have experience with the new thermometer at the summit.  It
may be the same one they previously used to feed Weather Underground
their information.  I'm going to dress assuming it's typical below
freezing but not far below freezing, but I'll bring emergency layers
for pre-race and post-race.

HR was post caffeine and very rushed, but probably would have been
high anyway due to my two beers last night while playing poker and my
rough sleep.  I wonder if there's any chance the coffee I had at
Michael Thomas wasn't decaf.

Surprised that my HR was so high.  I went to bed early last night and
slept a few hours before waking up here and there.  I would have
guessed that between not running much yesterday and all the sleep that
my HR would be down to 47 or so.  OTOH, my sleep was definitely
fragmented, partially due to my thinking about my poker work.

New HRM battery.  Oh yeah, I got up in the middle of the night to
change it because I couldn't sleep and I had been getting some dodgy
readings lately.  I think I may go to changing it once a month as an
experiment.

I did not sleep well last night.  Considering I had two low caffeine
days in a row, I attribute much of it to all the salsa I had.
However, I'm also in a very exciting phase of my poker work and that
certainly interfered with me getting to sleep on time.  To be safe,
I'm going to go back to no salsa between now and BMDM, and I'm also
going to go back to "no brain work after 8pm", which will include
reading email, especially poker-related email.

BTW, although I forgot to check the temperature after I got back,
there's a storm coming in, so two hours after I finished the temp had
only risen 2F from my reading three and a half hours prior.  Normally
there'd be over a 10F rise during that time period (I think).

I went to bed around 6pm.  I did have trouble sleeping from around
1:30 to 2:30, as well as my need to get up and pee about 5 times.  I
woke up around 4:50.

Yesterday was a down day due primarily to lack of sleep the night
before (too much caffeine), but presumably compounded by only having a
single espresso in the morning rather than my normal double.

    FWIW, we didn't have two complete packages of the spaghetti I
    normally eat that is 1890 calories, so I eyeballed enough of a
    different spaghetti (whose calorie content I don't know) to make
    approximately the same volume of spaghetti as the 1890 package.
    As of 10:30, I've eaten all of that first batch.  Later this
    afternoon I'll eat a second batch that I made from a complete,
    1890 calorie, package.

I totally screwed up my caffeine plan by accidentally packing in my
bike/run transition bag one of my Hammer gel flasks with a quad
espresso in it.  I woke up in the morning and couldn't find that
flask, so I took two cups of coffee from the hotel with me to drink
instead of the quad espresso, but that may easily have been more
caffeine.  Still, when I got to the bike/run transition I drank half
the flask (i.e., a double espresso).  Then, I felt like I had too much
caffeine for a while, so didn't have any more until I had finished the
snowshoe down (I think), when I had half the flask that I had packed
in my snowshoe bag.

However, when I was preparing my flasks I actually had some extra
espresso left over and wound up topping up my flasks.  I haven't
actually measured how much extra that was, but I certainly felt
overcaffeinated during and after the run, although I also ate one and
a half dark chocolate bars, so perhaps the extra theobromine (?
600mg?) added to what I was feeling.

Wunderground is not working right, so it's hard for me to tell what
the temperature is.  It's allowing me to use the 429 url, but when I
choose the change panel to see the stations nearby, 429 isn't listed,
nor are any others that are particularly close.  Wunderground used to
be pretty solid but slowly they've devolved.  If this doesn't clear up
in a couple of weeks, I'll have to figure out something else.

Because I had cleaned the neck of the bottle, when I started pouring
the hot sauce, a ton came out.  I chose to microwave the bowl and then
see just how spicy it was.  My idea was that if it was too spicy, I'd
dilute it.  It seemed fairly spicy to my mouth, but not *that* spicy.
I guess my mouth is used to it now, because after I ate it I started
sweating profusely.  My stomach also complained just a little, but it
had already been upset (and quieted down) from my morning ibuprofen on
an empty stomach (albeit w/ 16 oz. water) followed by 3 double
espressos.

46.6F at end

HR measured differently than normal. I did not sleep well last night, mostly
due to stress, but also compounded by a search-and-rescue callout that I
did not go on (Margaret's upcomimg BMDM experience is higher priority).  So,
when I woke up a little before 5am, I put my HRM on and then tried to get
back to sleep.  The 54 bpm is my HR right before I woke up.

Normally I put my HRM on, lie down, wait until my HR goes down about
as low as I think it will in a minute or two and then hold my breath
and record the lowest reading I see, because that is quicker than
trying to be relaxed for fifteen minutes and experimentally--although
with very few trials--this appeared to give similar results to wearing
my HRM over night and then looking for the low spots.  My
breath-holding methodology appears to be consistent with itself from
day today, but it may have diverged from the longer protocol and it
undoubtedly produces a number that is lower than what most people
would claim is their resting HR.

Anyway, like last year, both my weight and my resting HR has crept up
as BMDM approaches.  Neither are particularly worrying, although I had
planned on doing better on both this year.

Got to bed late for me last night due to going to O'Niell's after RubiABQ.
Elvis had some sort of stomach bug and was up much of the night throwing
up, so that too interfered with my sleep.  As such, I woke up to the alarm
clock and didn't take my HR until after I had done my core exercise.  Cocoa
Conspiracy is canceled, Sophie isn't working and the kids have the day off
from school, so I hung out at home until Sophie wanted her cappuccino.

Anyway, my HR would have been higher had I taken it at my normal time.
It was definitely higher when I took it an hour and a half after my
core exercise (55 bpm @ 7:58)

??.?F at end (truck thermometer) -- forgot to check, was too trashed

weight was pre-pooping, HR was rushed and after ~3 double espressos I
had sufficiently annoying flu-like body aches last night that it
interfered with my sleep.  Additionally, I hadn't really thought
through the GI repercussion of a 4:30 start until I woke up.  So, I
wound up taking ibuprofen after all (due to the body aches) and also
had my caffeine earlier than I planned with the hopes that I'd be able
to empty my GI tract sooner, rather than later.  Oh, and I didn't do
the complete low-fiber protocol yesterday in part because of various
issues that were still up in the air (my upcoming trip to Phoenix)
when I started preparing my food.

The good news is I didn't have to stop to poop along the way.  The bad
news is I desperately wanted to.  I'm glad I got the early start
though.  In some sense it would have been more realistic for me to
start at 6:30, but seeing how I was running a flat course in road
shoes, the difference between today and a real BMDM were going to be
overwhelming regardless, so getting it out of the way early was the
right thing to do.

Today was weird. Team RWB canceled our standing Sunday get-together,
so I planned on getting to the Alameda Open Space just before 7am so I
could ride my bike some distance and then drive home.  Since I had
pushed myself somewhat yesterday, I figured I might ride 10 or 20
miles, but ...

...when I got there, Joe was there.  Nobody had told him that the Team
RWB meeting was canceled. So I walked with Joe for about an hour.
When we got back to the parking lot, we ran into KK and Jerry, so we
chatted a bit, then I finally started my bike ride.

Riding back, I ran into Roleen, so I reversed direction and rode with
her a little bit.  After getting back to the truck, George and Nora
pulled up, so I rode with them.  Along my ride I stopped a couple
times to visit with Tova.

So, I wound up riding 66.95 miles today when I wasn't even sure I was
going to ride 10.  I also walked 2.77 miles with Joe, before riding.

I had planned on returning my diet to its normal schedule today, but
all the unscheduled riding totally interfered with that, as did the
additional calories I burnt.  The beer I had hit me hard and I wound
up taking a nap before even finishing it.

BARGE mailing list, my HR was post-caffeine, very rushed and after

1500? oatmeal, but with an accidental ton of Udo's 3-6-9 and little soy milk
      I was distracted as I made my cereal this morning and I started pouring
      Udo's directly into the cereal as though it were soy milk, instead of
      into the 1/2 tablespoon measure.  I quickly caught myself, but not
      before a ton (5 tablespoons?) went in to the cereal.  I thought about
      throwing it away or skimming the oil off for future use, but I decided
      to top off the remaining portion with soy milk, stir it up and take a
      bite.  It tasted fine.  We'll see what happens ...

I did not sleep well last night due to a combination of the caffeine,
all the salsa I ate and the state of my poker software.  In particular,
I added logging to the database and it had several issues, all of which
were fairly easily fixed, so although I tried to resist temptation, I
wound up fixing them all except one and then going back to bed.

Forgot to look at the temp before I started, but it was probably over 60

didn't look at thermometer, because I got tangled up in poker stuff and
did not exercise in the morning

HR was high in part because I woke up just before 5:15 and by the time
I had my HRM on the 5:15 alarm went off while I was trying to take
this morning's reading.  Still, I was excessively tired yesterday and
perhaps I've overtrained.  My training schedule certainly doesn't look
like that to me, however, I don't feel I'm 100% recovered from
whatever lung infection I had about a month ago, so perhaps that's
part of the puzzle.

73.6F half hour after finishing

HR was legitimately high; this was not me pressed for time.  I didn't
really feel well this morning, although I didn't feel sick, either.
OTOH, I hadn't exercised in a while and am also aware that my HR
*could* be due to low battery, even though I don't think so.  Anyway,
I decided to caffeinate up and then run using the hand-helds I had in
the fridge from Monday's non-run (due to truck bezel replacement).

This is my longest streak of non-running due to non-health,
non-recovery issues.  Saturday I didn't run because I didn't have a
plan in place for the morning and I wound up programming and never
going running.  There may have been other issues, but it's so long ago
I can't remember.  Sunday, our SAR team was asked to volunteer to
prepare food boxes for relief, so I did that.  It was exercise,
although non-aerobic.  Monday, I had to take my truck in to have the
bezel installed.  Yesterday I had a bunch of things to do in
preparation for the evening's tournament and I simply coded from the
time I got up until an hour before the tournament and by that time it
was too late.

So, I figured with all that rest, I'd have a nice low resting HR, but
that was not the case.  One thing that I've been doing lately is
adding *a lot* of Tabasco to make up for running out of Andrew's
Insanity Sauce.  I don't *think* that's an issue, but I'm going to
back off.  I've also found that my lungs get cranky after just a
little (equivalent of two beers) alcohol, so no beer for me until
Saturday or Sunday.

73.0F @ end (8:34) -- didn't check it right before I ran.  Oops.

Yesterday's O'Niell's was an exercise in poor judgment.  I ordered
french fries because I hadn't had them in a while and the amount they
gave me was huge, so I ate them all.  Pre-lockdown O'Niell's had more
vegan options, but yesterday they only had the Impossible Burger and
buffalo cauliflower wings.  Since I had done a ruck run earlier in the
day I went with the IB, but I should have had a side of fruit (like
Margaret did!) instead of the fries.

230 10 (moldy?) dates -- I definitely smelled m?old as I was eating

       any mold as I was counting out the dates, but Sophie does tend to
       buy dates way in advance and keep them in a hot garage, so they're
       often stale ...

I didn't have any water or calories until after spud patch.  I got lost
and wound up doing some bushwhacking.  I had my 3rd double espresso at
about mile 10.  I drank some chia water.

At Rock Tank, my big calorie source was a bunch of oatmeal.  I ate
three fig newtons that were supplied by (I believe) the Gordons.  I
also drank a beer. I wound up putting all 6 tablespoons of chia into
my two bottles, even though one of them already had a lot of chia water
stilll in it.  That was a mistake, although I did use aid station water
to thin it out later.

I did not eat any nuts during the race, nor did I use any Tailwind or
gels.  This was not a strategy, per-se.  I really didn't plan my
nutrition, nor did I try to optimize for speed.

Today's ruck run turned into a ruck walk when I ran into George, Nora
and Derek.  They were walking around Albuquerque Academy carrying
U.S. flags to commerate Veteran's Day.  I walked with them, which was
a little tricky because I wound up needing to take a pee break due, in
part, to not sweating as much and also not finishing as quickly.

Never did exercise today.  Got to the kitchen to fill my water bottles
and found I'm in arrears for some taxes.  That triggered a "family
discussion" and by the time I was done it was too close to lunch for
me to want to leave and after lunch I didn't really have the energy.
Today has not been a good day, but it's probably a (painful) step in
the right direction.

We ran out of espresso, so I slept in for real, not getting out of bed
until about 7am.  I then had to rush to get out the door.  I didn't
try the ignition in my truck.  It wasn't working yesterday.  HR in
Sophie's van was around 47 bpm, I think.  Temperature was about 30F
before I turned it off.

Roleen, Rhoda and Demetria from Team RWB came out, but they wanted to
walk and I wanted to run, so I ran to and crossed the bridge, then ran
back.  I hung out until the walkers returned, then I drove over to
Michael Thomas to pick up espresso.

Huge weight gain due to all the bread (including tortilla) I ate
yesterday.  It was an experiment.  I was tired all of yesterday and
wanted to see if eating more would perk me up.  It didn't.  I enjoyed
eating the bread (it was homemade) but I don't think it helped
(although I'm writing this *before* my pack speed run).

In addition to eating a ton of carbs yesterday, I'm also doing a few
other things different than my 7 mile speed run in 2018.  I had a
double espresso at my standard time, but I'm drinking two more one
half hour before I run.  Additionally, I'm going to run at 6:45 rather
than 6:30 so that there will be more light (although that may mean I
wait longer at the stoplight at Barstow and Harper).

Just before my run I am also going to drink the Tailwind I had
leftover from Saturday's run.  That way I don't have to try to draw
from the bladder that doesn't work very well during my run although as
it is, I can't get the last bit of Tailwind out of my Amphipod bottles
easily while running.

I'm also switching to my Speed 3 playlist from my Speed 9 last week.
