It was about 10F when I woke up. I chose to wait and run much later
than normal.  I also knew that my intervals were going to suck both
due to having run a 50k two days prior and it being cold enough that I
had to wear too much clothing for when I was moving slowly.  Turns out
I also didn't want to switch my tunes from random songs to Speed 3,
because I was nervous about taking my iPod away from my body as well
as being nervous about taking my hands out of my gloves. So, my
intervals were especially poor.

Woke (from a dream) to my alarm at 5:15.  Not too surprising since I
didn't sleep well initially (presumably due to yesterday's beers),
waking up for a few minutes at a time at least through midnight.  So,
HR is post caffeine.

FWIW, I've gone back to 2 tablespoons of hemp seed instead of 4 in my
oatmeal.  4 was an experiment that I did due to having ordered such a
huge bag of hemp seed.

poop was at 5:41 and was not full size, but I prioritized eating
planning to wear fully loaded ice hat

*AFTER* my run, I put a new battery in my HRM.  My HRM was reading low
for a while toward the end and that may have contributed to me being a
little slower than I might have been otherwise, although I was only 6
seconds per mile off my PR and I am about a pound and a half heavier
(and I also started out with > 2 pounds of water in my 70 oz. water
bladder), so I *probably* ran @ about 150bpm, which was my target.

Did not sleep well last night.  Worked after the evening tournament
when I shouldn't have, then did a late night deploy when I shouldn't
have, and of course the deploy failed, so it took me a little while to
roll-back, then Elvis and I had a late night discussion and I couldn't
get back to sleep, but I did deploy a fix at least.

Monday 20210405 weight 162.4 50 bpm @ 5:23 forgot to check temperature

Did not get to sleep until late due to the house being hot. I cracked
my window, but it took a very long time for the temp to drop.  Woke up
at 4:15 and went back to bed after a super small potty break, then my
alarm woke me up. Frustrating to sleep so poorly after four low
espresso days.  Oh well.

Woke up and decided to skip most of my pre-run ritual and just run
shortly after pooping.  This meant that when I got back I had to make
my oatmeal and tomorrow's espresso, etc., but it did allow me to get a
15.5 mile run in before it got hot.  I've already made not only
tomorrow's espresso, but I've also made my oatmeal.  We'll see how it
tastes after sitting in the fridge a day.

Tomorrow I'll start my core exercises shortly after 5:15.  I expect to
do worse than I normally do, just like I expect most of my fasted
stats to be worse.  OTOH, that means I'll get out the door before six
and should be back *and done* by 7:30.

     in, something I've been doing off and on for about a month.  We
     get whole bean espresso and only grind the beans just prior to
     pulling the shots.  Typically there's a small amount of ground
     espresso left over which I had been throwing out. However, I've
     eaten chocolate covered espresso beans before, so now I thought
     about adding the excess to my oatmeal, which enhances (IMO) the
     flavor and probably gives me a little extra caffeine).

Since I spent much of the day waiting around for people to come to the
turnaround aid station, I texted myself notes on everything I ate and
drank.  As such, everything up until 4pm is recorded properly.  I
didn't record anything after 4pm, but I think the only thing I had was
my nut snack, since I was fairly full after eating my two servings of
oatmeal.  I hadn't initially planned on saving them for last, but
since they were in sealed containers and surrounded by ice, I knew
they would keep well.

weight 158.7 post core, post 8.9 mile run, post second (big!) poop

After weighing myself the firt time I thought I shouldn't have eaten
the Oreos. I had done so because it was hard for me to guage just how
many calories I burned playing on the mountain yesterday.  However,
I've recently started doing my core exercise ASAP after my double
espresso even if that means before my first poop.  I think that then
causes me to not empty completely which leads to a higher than normal
weight.  OTOH, taking my weight after a run where I don't drink any
water gives my a lower than normal weight.

So, my guess is I lost weight even with the Oreos.

I woke up feeling bloated, but was relieved (I thought!) after I
pooped.  I went out and did my warm-up AA loop and chose to run home
and sit on the can again before going back out to do my intervals.
Shortly after leaving the house I doubled back and sat some more.
When I did my intervals the GI distress didn't seem to be holding me
back, per-se, but my legs did feel slow and I'm guessing that's due to
the Chimney Canyon Threepeat on Saturday.  *After* doing my intervals
my gut was complaining enough that I spent the next two laps mostly
walking and even when I was running it was at a slow pace.

First poop was pre-core and tiny.  Had another during core and it too
was tiny.  Had 2 oz. water before second poop, so weight included that
water.

Spent a bunch of time on the can after core, but ... nothing, so I went
running.

After getting back and eating my oatmeal and drinking my rice milk, I
had a good sized poop and weight 159.1.  It looks like doing my core
at 5:15 interferes with full sized poops and hence my morning
weight. Oh well, at least I get my core done quickly.

Had some minor GI distress last night that interfered with sleep.
Tripped (when I had just decided to take my first drink) after the
ascent at the beginning of my third AA lap.  Did a lot of walking
after, not because of the tripping (AFAIK), but most likely due to the
minor unpleasantness in my gut combined with the heat.

Saturday 20210508 weight 158.9? at 11:45pm Friday night (I weighed myself,
                          but forgot to log it)

I did the first ascent (Cienega) fasted, but then ate a ton of nuts on
the drive from Sulphur Canyon Picnic Grounds to the base of the tram.
I was pretty hungry but couldn't get to anything else (and the nuts
tasted very good).

I tended to stuff myself at the truck but not eat anything during the
hiking.  The four uncaffeinated gels were an exception and I think I
ate them on Domingo Baca.  I definitely ate them all at once.

I ate the four caffeinated gels at once at thebase of the tram, just
for the caffeine (4x 35mg), because I had planned on having a double
espresso before each of the last four ascents, *but* I left the cap to
one of my espresso bottles loose and one of my double espressos leaked
all over my clothing bag.

I always started with a full 40 oz. bladder, but I don't think I drank
much, if at all, on the first ascent (it was 39F when we got to the
top and I was shirtless in shorts, but with my leather climbing
gloves). I think I drank about half on the second ascent and then I
drank most or all on the remaining ascents.

Saturday 20210522

I did not write down everything I ate.  I know I had a bunch oranges
here and there.  I think I went through 12 caffeinated gels and
another 4 non-caffeinated ones.  I ran out of water three times, so I
consumed at least 120 oz. of water, probably much more.  My goto foods
were potato chips and potatos.  Of the stuff I brought myself, I
believe I ate 12 of my own (caffeinated) gels and a bunch of oreos and
potato chips.  I didn't have any of the Jolly Rancher hard candies,
nor did I open the one tube of Pringles.  So, although the stuff I
list at various time-stamps / mile markers below is stuff I ate, some
of the other stuff that I mention in this paragraph is not explicitly
listed below.

Had it not been so windy I might have taken the time to write things
down soon after I crossed the finish line, but instead I tore down my
tent ASAP, got some food, met Mark, then got on the road to go home.
Then I wound up going biking early the following day...

Got off to a late start.  First it was sitting on the can (in part due
to the powerful analgesic I took yesterday evening), then I had
trouble with my iPod touch, so I decided to connect it to my iMac (and
avoid the wonky dongle that I use with my Macbook Pro), but I hadn't
powered up my iMac in a long time, so I had to futz with it...

Used a porta-potty in the Hoffmantown Baptist parking lot.  Had
already planned on running home when I saw it.  Wound up doing a lot
of walking and still ran out of water with two miles to go.

Forgot to weigh myself before heading out on my ride, so my weight is

a small amount of rice milk afterward because that's all I had left.

Got bit of a stomach ache after my noon oatmeal.  My suspicion is that
the nectarine I had was too old and that's causing the discomfort,
since pretty much everything else is stuff I eat regularly and the
nectarine did look a little funky and taste a little leathery.

Woke to my alarm.  Tired due to poor sleep which was due to a stomach
ache which may have been due to eating a dodgy nectarine or it could
have been due to all the junk I put in my stomach on Saturday.
There's even a chance that I caught something that Margaret had

Did not sleep well last night due to stomach trouble.  Not surprising
that my HR was way higher than normal due to lack of sleep alone, but
my drinkng yesterday evening also contributed to the high HR.

Slightly smokey as I rode my bike.  I felt OK, but didn't feel like I
was getting the speed I should for my HR, although to be fair I rode
fasted and don't normally run my HR that high, so I don't have
anything to compare it to. However, after I finished I felt a bunch of
cold-like symptoms and it's fairly clear that whatever got me earlier
in the week is lingering longer than I expected.  Ugh.

Chose not to have any calories after getting back home due to a
combination of feeling a bit sick and wanting to program without
getting slowed down by my body getting tired once I feed it.  I'm also
a little nervous that my stomach discomfor will grow significantly
when I put more food in.

Woke to alarm clock, started my core exercises late, but got them
done.  I then spent a bunch of time spreading out wet gear from SJS50
so that it might dry before it starts raining again.  As such, I got
off to my run *VERY* late.

I cut my run short so I could get home and rejigger the spread out
gear and also spread out some delicates to be air dried before the
rain came in.  As such, I at my lunch late.  OTOH, I've finally put

HR ridiculously high.  I have no explanation other than still
recovering from SJS50, but that was a week ago and my HR normally
settles down by now.  FWIW, hiking up Chimney Canyon was tougher than
it was as the fourth ascent of Elevation Insanity.  It was also
tougher than my *third* Chimney Canyon ascent on Chimney Canyon
threepeat.

up working for more than twelve hours, with a brief time for lunch and

Had a hard time sleeping last night, due in part to stomach
discomfort.  No more Tabasco or salsa between now and Hardrock for me.
I don't know what initially bothered my stomach, but it doesn't seem
to be going away and lack of sleep is pretty bad.

Did not get a good HR reading because my initial values were so high I
didn't write them down, thinking my HR would go down.  It didn't.  As
such, my 58 is a guess.

My weight was after taking a big dump, which caused me to do my core
late.

      they both had enough ground espresso that they looked the same

I shouldn't have had that third beer, but when I got back to camp
after playing poker and pushing files around, I quickly got everything
ready for the following morning only to not find my phone.  I spent a
bunch of time looking for it and in frustration decided to have a
third beer while I searched some more.  When it got dark I stopped
searching (all my headlamps are in my drop bags, I didn't think to
bring a spare, even though I have one at home) and then fretted about
it throughout the night, including waking up thinking that perhaps I
hadn't checked my laptop bag.

So, my HR was high this morning both from the alcohol and attendant
lack of sleep, but also because I didn't have a steady light source to
shine on the GPS watch, so I couldn't even relax.

At 5:15 my "time to take my espresso" alarm went off both on my iPod
(which I had set up in case I couldn't hear my phone) and on my phone,
which I finally found on the roof of my truck on the passenger's side.

My HRM read ridiculously low a bit during my substitute run (I
normally ride my bike on Sundays), but when it was working my HR
seemed fine for my pace fo the altitude and temperature.  If I
remember, I'll buy a new CR2032 battery.

      my ice chest is low on ice because the grocery store was out

Coffee Bear, where I had parked my truck and since they had vegan burritos,
I ordered one and had it and did a little more work on my laptop

1:00? Coffee Bear
??? vegan burrito without green chile and mild salsa (ordered with green
    chile, but didn't see or taste any)

The rain was light, so I decided to move my truck near the library and
have a beer and some food.  While I was eating I walked up the road a bit]
and saw a statue of Jesus in the distance.  Since I had more time to kill
I walked back to my truck, got the second beer, second bagel and two
carrots and walked up to the statue, sat down, had my seond beer and
finished my food and walked back.

2:00 - 2:45 killing time before the "The How of Hardrock" presentation
??? 2x (12 oz. 8.5% ABV Boulevard Tank 7 Saisson)
??? 2 (the rest) bagels
??? 5 or more (the rest) non-slimy broccoli florets (some were getting
    slimy so I ate around them and threw out what remained)
??? handful of "power greens"
??? two carrots

5:30 - 7:00 dinner with Pete
??? ? oz. ~9% ABV  Yeti Imperial Stout (split roughtly 50/50 with Pete the
    tall boy can that I crushed without looking at the volume or ABV)
~000 Backpacker's Pantry cuban beans and rice (didn't look at the info
     on the pack, it was raining a bit)
??? huge double-handful of Pete's peanut butter pretzel chunks
??? 12 oz. ?% ABV Goose Islan IPA (Pete gave it to me)

7:00 nut snack
680 4 oz. mixed nuts

I was shirtless in light rain, standing under a tree chatting away with
Pete as I ate and drank. I was slightly chilled when I got into my tent
at about 7.  I crawled into my sleeping bag and mostly slept until about
9:45 when I retroadtively filled in my post-soy-latte info for today's
eating.  I don't think I forgot anything.

Wednesday 20210714 weight ???.? ?? bpm @ ?:??

5:15 wake-up
10 double espresso

OOPS. I didn't write down what I ate (or drank) the last couple of
days before Hardrock or what I ate during or after Hardrock and now
(August 9th!) I don't remember all the details.

I definitely screwed up my eating during Hardrock though.  I simply
didn't have a specific plan.  I decided to eat what was available at
the aid stations, but that sometimes resulted in me eating too much
and I definitely had too much vegan cheese-based quesadillas in
Telluride.  That caught up to me so badly that I eventually had to
stop eating and go without calories for an extended period (up to, but
*not including* Kroger's canteen, although I didn't think to ask for
tequila while I was up there).

Another huge fail was I had my final quad espresso waiting for me at
the final aid station where we can have drop bags, but I was feeling
peppy so I put it in my pack "for later."  However, by the time I got
sleepy I was so sleep deprived that I couldn't put two and two
together and bring myself to drink it. I knew I had it at times and
other times I forgot that I had it, but as I got sleepier and sleepier
my ability to think rationally fell off precipitously.

Oh, and although it wasn't an eating or drinking failure, I *chose*
not to use my trekking poles until the approach to Kroger's.  That was
STUPID!

I didn't write down how much ibuprofen I consumed, but I was willing
to take 200mg before the race (which I'm pretty sure I did) and then
another 200mg every four hours.  I believe in reality I never took it
within four hours of my previous dose and I may have had as little as
1200 mg all told, but it's unlikely I had as much as 2,000 mg all told
(I actually wrote this paragraph on August 29th, over a month
afterward, because a friend of mine was asking me about my ibuprofen
use and I thought "I log it all", only to find out I skipped that
section of this log for HR100.  Ugh!).

I finished at about 2am and all I wanted to do was get in my warm
sleeping bag and sleep, *but* I was pretty dirty but too tired to
take a shower, so I wound up keeping my feet (the dirtiest part of
me, by far) out of the bag.  I did take my double espresso at 5:15am
and was even going to go for a run with Peter, but someone got into
the toilet before I did, so I was away from my tent when he showed
up.

Anyway, I definitely had some beer at the award's ceremony (9am).  I
also had two plates of all the vegan stuff they had (I think hash
browns, fruit and salsa mostly).  Later that day I did a bunch more
drinking and ate with abandon.

Monday I drove back and I *think* I did it fasted. My guess is that
the first thing I did when I got back was have more beer, but by now I
don't actually remember that.

Once I fell off the food logging wagon, I didn't get fully back on

From this point on I was not writing down much (if anything) about
what I was eating or drinking.  I know that on my trip I brought 4
Aventinuses and 8 Barrel Aged Narwhals and that I gave away at least
two Barrel Aged Narwhals and probably an Aventinus or two.  By the
time I left for the airport I only had one of each left (and I drank
them both in the airport on an empty stomach although not both at the
same time).  At the table I was drinking Elysian Space Dust IPA an
8.2% ABV typically out of what I believe were 16 oz. cups.  Most of
the time I was at the table I had one of those every two hours or so.

I brought a bunch of pre-measured oatmeal setups (oatmeal, hemp seeds,
and chia seeds) as well as pre-measured bags of lentils, adzuki beans
and 10-bean soup mix.  By the time I left I had consumed all of those,
I believe.

Most days I went to breakfast with others at Sid's (the sole exception
I think was Saturday when I went to Peppermill).  The first day I had
a big (24 oz.) beer and their potatoes.  Most other days I just had
their potatoes.  The beer was pricey and made me need to pee.

I used the slow cooker I had brought from Albuquerque to prepare my
beans, lentils and oatmeal.  I also brought some amount of mixed nuts
and dates.  I wound up eating all of them eventually.

Overall, considering it was BARGE, I think I did well on my diet,
drinking and exercise.  I skimped a little, but not much, on my sleep,
*BUT* I didn't spend anywhere near as much time with my friends as I'd
have liked (or had expected to), because I often went back to my room
and crashed after a fairly early tournament.

We made an IGM-based deal in the TOC-style tournament, so that
ostensibly ended at about 11pm PDT, but it took over a half hour for
me to get paid, so all told I got to bed after midnight.  I then got
up the next day and did a bunch of running before going to the
Peppermill with a few people.  I played "fairly well" in the NLHE
event, but did make an egregious mistake that didn't cripple me but
took away my lead when I was last to act and took a poke at a pot with
an exceedingly good draw only to have Ben Gamble go all-in.  I thought
about it and folded, but I should have called.  In retrospect I think
a call was *probably* negative EV, but not very much so and if I won I
would have been able to severely bully from that point on.  Perhaps
I'd have played it differently with more sleep or less alcohol (or
more pratice playing No-limit in meatspace).

I don't remember what else I had that day although I do know that I
drank so much I desperately needed to pee before a break came around
and actually had to leave the table.  I learned from that and wound up
limiting how much I drank on other days, not to cut back on the
alcohol, but to keep from needing an inopportune potty break.

I don't remember if I had anything until I went to the airport.  I had
to check out at 11am, but my flight wasn't due to take off until 10pm.
I know that while I was there I drank my two remaining cans of beer:

??? 16 oz 11.9% Sierra Nevada Barrel Aged Narwhal Imperial Stout
??? 16.9 oz. 8.2% ABV Schneider Weisse Aventinus

later I realized that I had access to a store after all and I wound up
eating a ton of Smokehouse Almonds, a large (but not family sized) bag
of Lays Barbeque potato chips and about a half a can of Pringles
original.

My flight was delayed (I had a cup of water on the plane) and I didn't
get back home until 3am.

I know I ate whatever I had leftover from the airport.  I *suspect* I also

I chose not to exercise though and spent most of the day in bed (and didn't
log my intake, because I hadn't been doing so regularly since Hardrock).

maybe that will make a difference.

Woke up at 5:13, so I got a slightly late (5:18) start to my core.  I
had trouble pooping due to the analgesic I took last night.  I had
some email that I needed to deal with before I ran, so I didn't get
around to taking my HR until late.

Chose not to run in the morning.  Might be a bad choice, but it is
what it is.

Woke to my alarm, so didn't get a HR reading.  Got off to a late
start, so didn't actually have any calories until 3pm.  Then there was
a tiny bit of rain and a lot of wind.  I was able to get my tent up
before the wind, but I didn't write down what I had eaten, so I may
have forgotten something.  However, I'm pretty sure I didn't bring
nuts or dates and I do know exactly which alcohol I drank, so I don't
think I forgot too much.

woke to the alarm, so never took my heart-rate.  I got to bed very

last week when I was too tired to clip out after 71 miles in the smoke.

Saturday 20210925

I think I had too much caffeine and perhaps not enough calories (I only
had about 900 calories for almost seven hours).  I probably would have
done better with two handhelds, no vest and no trekking poles.  I think I
did my first half fairly well, although it looks like I was out of the
aid station five or six minutes after I was out in 2018.

In 2018 I had three *double* espressos total.  Yesterday I had seven.
I think next time I should go back to three.  Back in 2018 I was using
Tailwind and chia.  I stopped using chia because it was messy and I
figured I was probably not getting much benefit from it, but ... I had my
best Mt. Taylor and my best JJ100 that year, so I'm thinking about going
back to it, even though it's messy.

I was also using vegan brownies then and I've read that caffeine and
theobromine stack well.  I'll experiment with reduced caffeine, added
chocolate and chia to Tailwind for AA50k this year and see how I do.

I did not write down most of what I ate up on Mt. Taylor as I was eating
it, so there's a chance I left something out.

Woke up at 5:11 and didn't get everything set up for me to start my
core exercises at *exactly* 5:15, even though I deferred taking my
heart-rate.  I wound up doing a half-assed HR check long after I
finished my core.  I want to get back in the habit of taking it, so
I got *a* number, but it's far higher than I'd have gotten otherwise.

Oh, the reason I slept so late is that I woke up in the middle of the
night and decided I had to finish graphical lammers, because they were
the final checkbox on a seventy checkbox list for issue #688 (add
graphical assets) and I had gone to bed knowing that there really
wasn't much left to finish them.

weight was after eating two bagels. HR was after bagels and caffeine and I

During the race I plan on eating a Simple Truth 85% cacao vegan
chocolate bar and taking 200 mg of espresso.  During most of the race
I plan on having one water bottle (or tube) with Tailwind in it
(typically mixed by me) and one with water, although from the start to
my first trip into Jackass Junction I'll only have a single handheld
with 20 oz. of water.

If I consume two tailwinds per loop, that's 400 calories.  Add in the
calories from the chocolate bar and I think that brings me up to
around what my body can process.  As such, I need to really limit my
snacking at aid stations.

Saturday & Sunday

5:15 wake-up
10 double espresso

5:45 pre-run calories
100 non-caffeinated gel I ate in my tent (before I knew I'd be eating
                                          the oatmeal)
??? two bowls of instant oatmeal prepared by Eric at the food tent

during the run itself I didn't take notes, but from memory:

I consumed five double espressos (I meant to consume six, but I had
put one my hammer gel bottels (with a quad espresso) in a bag that I
didn't visit.  As such, I had an instant coffee at one of the aid
stations.  I consumed a variety of caffeinated gels and some of the
Tailwind at the aid stations had caffeine in it.

I brought two chocolate bars with me and ate one and two-thirds.  Each
bar is 570 calories.  I didn't eat any of the nuts I had with me
(although I did eat them after the race on Sunday).

I chose to run without any water from the start to Mesa Portales (the
aid station at mile 9).  From there I then ran a lot with two
hand-helds, which wasn't enough water, but I was never dehydrated,
per-se when I got into aid stations, just thirstier than I'd have been
if I had been drinking to thirst.  However, I think that thirstiness
unfavorably skewed some of my replenishment choices and so I probably
consumed too much Tailwind and maybe too much of some other things
too, especially early in the race when it was fairly hot and I hadn't
yet made myself semi-nauseous.

When I thought that we had 36 hours to finish the race, I was planning
on having a strong beer at the turnaround.  Turns out we only had 34,
so I left the beer for later.

AFAIK, the only non-vegan things I had were some mashed potatoes and a
very thin slice of cherry pie.

For warm things, I had some more oatmeal, the mashed potatoes I
mentioned and the coffee.  Beyond that I ate a fair amount of
peanut-butter pretzels (Pete Livingstone turned me on to them), a few
(three?) oranges, some pickles, two packages of Twizzlers (each had to
tiny Twizzlers in them), a 100 calorie package of almonds, a few bags
of potato chips (at least two bags of barbeque, one regular and one
ruffles).

I'm probably forgetting other things, but I pretty much had too much to
eat early on and then significantly cut back on the calories in the latter
half (and felt *MUCH* better).

I pooped off-trail twice.

Monday 20211108 weight 161.0

Initially could not find my heart rate monitor strap, so I packed up,
tore down my tent and drove back to Albuquerque.  I did find it while
packing up, but I figured my HR was elevated by then and didn't want
to take the time.

After I got home I plugged in a bunch of rechargable batteries and
started washing my delicates.  The delicates were just finishing when
I had done my first pass at putting things away, so I hung them out to
dry before doing my recovery run.

Woke to my alarm.  Decided to drink my double espresso right at the

Luis was a little late driving up from Socorro, so instead of starting
at 8am we started at (TODO).  I hadn't thought through my pre-run
calories but I had a bunch of Jolly Rancher candies, so I started
sucking on them to get a little sugar into my system as I worked on
mb2 waiting for Luis to arrive.

I don't know what the temperature was at the start, because my truck
was sitting in the sun, but it was 40F when I got to the White Ridge
Bike Trails.

Woke to alarm, then had a lot of trouble with my heart-rate monitor.
I tried switching batteries, but it eventually stopped blinking its
lights as I inserted new batteries, so I had to go back to my old HRM
which itself was questionable.  Ugh.

was a character and made it to 104.

My water consumption below is based on looking at how much I had left
from the 24 oz. bottles I started with.  Normally I would not have
turned off my watch after returning to my truck, but my hands were
sufficiently cold that they couldn't use the brakes efficiently which
wasn't safe, so I stopped, went to the bathroom, let my hands warm up,
took off my hat, put my hat in my truck and otherwise chewed up
fifteen minutes.

Woke up to alarm.  Tried to quickly get a heart-rate reading, but
didn't even write down the number I got at the time. I think it was
about 50 bpm.  I did not sleep well last night. Ghost (the family dog)
got up in the night disoriented, so I let her sleep on my bed. She was
running in her sleep multiple times and that woke me in addition to
the times I needed to use the toilet.

Drinking the water was a big mistake.  I also should have had all my
stuff ready to go the night before and then had a quad espresso at
5:15, then got out the door as soon as I had pooped.

Woke up to alarm, so my HR was after I had my caffeine, but before I
got moving.  Am going to try to pattern my pre-run calories and
caffeine on Black Friday 2018, although I don't have avocados (I
didn't look forward enough on the calendar to get them). In fact, I
don't think we have any bananas, either, as such I may just eat about
the same amount of calories in mixed nuts, since we have them and they
have more fat than anything else (other than Udo's oil) we have in the
house.

Did not sleep well. Chose to sleep in.  Chose to not take my caffeine
until after I pooped so I could do my core w/o delay, but then
eventually gave up and took my caffeine and then pooped and decided
not to do core.  Then, when it was time to make my replacement
espresso I decided to make an extra and have it and do core. That did
not go well. I had a sore on my butt that prevented me from doing my
sit-ups and when it came time to do my nose-to-the-ground push-ups, I
only did 20 rather than my scheduled 29.  Ugh.  And now the bonus
caffeine may interfere with tonight's sleep.  I guess I'll find out.

It was cold when I got up, and I had been feeling a little sick
lately, so I didn't go out early to run.  When Sophie was up, she
checked her email and found she had tested positive for covid-19. So,
I chose to stay in all day.  I didn't write down when I took it, but
at one point it was 13F at the Heritage Hills weather site.

No exercise and erratic eating is pushing my weight up.  Oh well, I'll
be back to normal soon, I think.  In the meantime, I'm staying home.

Went to bed early (7pm?) mostly slept through the night although I did have
some time when I read instead of slept. Was dead asleep when my 5:15 alarm
went off, so I deliberately chose not to take my caffeine with the idea
that I'd take it when I felt up to doing my core, which I did about three
hours later.

I did not want to interrupt my sleep to take my heart rate.

I went to bed and sleep at about 7pm yesterday (after losing quite
quickly in the Dramaha 49 tournament). Although I woke up almost every
hour to go to the bathroom, I basically slept until 4:40, which
strongly suggested that I was still fighting someting off.  I then
chose to run in a fasted state without ibuprofen or my ice hat and
... not surprisingly, my pace was horrible.

Got up with the intent to do a long pack run with intervals, but spent
a little time cleaning up my room waiting, in part, for Sophie to
stir.  Today's her first day back at work and I wanted to make her a
capuccino if she wanted one (and she did).

Got all the way to adjusting my straps on my pack and then I noticed
the frame was broken in half on the curved bottom connecting piece.
I've never seen a break there before, but the pack was scraped up
there from one of my falls.  This news kind of pushed me over the
edge.  I had been on the fence about running since I still have a
little congestion in my lungs.  I also was in the middle of fixing a
regression (in my poker software) that was pretty tricky, so I chose
to not run until I had it fixed.

I fixed that particular bug right at lunchtime.  It's a gray day, so
my guess is I won't run after all.  Ugh.
