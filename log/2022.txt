     left over from Saturday.  I don't know for sure, but my guess is (based
     on the taste comparison) is that the 2/3rd full one only started with
     one 200 calorie package, too.  I did not drink all 20 oz. of either

Weight was after my second poop at 6:50.  It was 162.7 after my first
around 5:20.

I did not run at 5:30 because it was cold and I didn't want to run
with large gloves which I wouldn't have a place for when I no longer
needed them.  My lightweight gloves have far too many holes in them to
be trustworthy at the 21F degrees it was at 5:30.

For the record, Ghost, my dog weighs 43.2 pounds. I decided to weigh
her because I carry her around a bunch due to her arthritis. It's not
enough to count for exercise, but it's kind of funny since that's
exceedingly close to the weight of my pack.

Woke to my alarm at 5:15.  Decided to put off the caffeine for 15
minutes so I could poop and take my heart rate and then start my core
exactly 15 minutes late.  However, I wound up pooping twice and still
missed 5:30 by 18 seconds acording to my Ambit's seconds display.

Did a deploy after my core exercises and had trouble due to
ws.devctm.com's certificate expiring.  I fixed that and then wrote up
three different GitHub issues to prevent it from causing so much
trouble in the future.  That meant I started running very late.

I did my mountain "run" today so I can do a 12-hour timed race around
Albuquerque Academy tomorrow.  My right knee is giving me a little
trouble so I chose to do it very slowly. As such, I did it fasted,
without extra caffeine, with random music (rather than my BMDM
playlist), no ice hat and fairly late in the day.  My stats were
horrible, but at least I got time on my feet and practice not falling.

Sunday 20220123 weight 160.8

Woke up too late to take my HR.  I did not sleep well last night.  I
tried to tough it out with no analgesics, but my discomfort was too
great.  By the time I took my ibuprofen it was too late to get a decen
night's sleep.  It took a while to kick in and relieve my body aches.

I seriously considered not running "Resolutions Stink!" today, but I
chose to do so and am glad (so far!) I did.  Tomorrow will be
... interesting.

Made it through the night with no analgesics, but by the time 4am
rolled around, I definitely had some body aches.  Since they were
nowhere near as bad as last night I decided to tough it out, knowing
that I'd have caffeine at 5:15 and that would get rid of them for the
remainder of the day.

So, I woke up to my alarm and didn't measure my HR before having my
espresso.  I also chose not to run today, but I did get a bunch of
programming done.

Got out the door late in part due to making Sophie a cappuccino and me
a replacement double espresso.  Additionally, I couldn't find my
GoLite tights or my Jackie tights, so I wound up wearing my REI very
loose leggings.

I chose not to bring water, even though my goal was 18.8 miles.  I
figured the cold would help reduce my water need and it did, but not
enough.  Kurt Coonrod had earlier pointed out that cold air is so dry
that you lose more water than you think due to that.  However, I
didn't want to deal with water freezng in my bottle or the fact that
drinking cold water might cool me down, but I wound up running less
that I might have had I properly hydrated, so I think I made the wrong
choice.  Basically I should always take at least one bottle when I'm
doing 15.5 or more miles.

My plans changed at the last minute. I got dressed and had my pack
prepared to go do my 24 mile 40# run when I read my email and saw that
the Tough Ruck Boston was announced.  That means I need to peak on
April 16th, rather than March 20th.  Consequently, it makes more sense
to baby my left foot and to push my 24 mile rucks out a bit.

Saturday 20220402 weight 163.8

Weight was after two tiny poops at 4:05am.  If I had kept my normal
schedule, it probably would have been closer to 163.0

I drank my double espresso early because I wanted to be on the road at
5am.  Sophie had gotten a free cup of Michael Thomas coffee the day
before but didn't drink much of it, so I also had that in the morning.

The day before I hastily threw together a bunch of stuff, including a
container of mixed nuts and a container of dates. Those were going to
be my mainstays, but I also grabbed a plastic bag full of ancient gels
and even more ancient Hammer products (a 270 calorie Perpetuem and a
couple single-use (100 calorie?) packets of Heed).

Unbeknownst to me, I didn't bring a bladder (I left it in my BMDM pack)
or the tubes that fit into the front sleeves of my ultra vest.  I did
bring 2 20 oz. handhelds and some bike water bottles. IIRC, I didn't
take any water with me on the first lap.  I don't recall the second
lap, but eventually I was doing a lap with a single handheld (and two
trekking poles) and I ran out of water at about mile 2.2. I slogged through
the rest of the loop, but instead of eating just one of the provided
oranges, I ate a bunch (four or five, I think).

I don't remember when I dumped the Heed into a bottle or when I dumped
the Perpetuem, but I definitely had too much of one or both of those
things and I was kind of bloated.  I chose to run my seventh lap with
just two handhelds with just water in them and to not use my trekking
poles.

After the sixth lap I ate a single date and then took two 200 mg
ibuprofens.  That seemed to help the tenderness in my feet, but I
think it wound up upsetting my stomach (which would then interfere
with my sleep hours later).

I did not take notes or pictures of the various things I ate, but I
also didn't eat a variety, so I suspect this is fairly close to what I
had.

Chose not to ride my bike due to wind. Perhaps a bad choice, since
wunderground isn't showing much wind yet and I could easily have
gotten in 35 miles before it picked up.  Oh well.  We were out of
coffee, so I went down to Michael Thomas at about 6:30 only to find
out they didn't open until 7am, so by the time I got back home it was
7:20.

I did wind up running out to Albuquerque Academy, then ran three loops
and back.  The wind was already picking up, so I probably got about as
much exercise as I would have had I ridden my bike, but I didn't burn
any gas to get out to the Alameda Open Space, so I'm glad I didn't
ride my bike after all.

My ultravest only weighed 7.5 pounds, because I took the bladder and
soft flasks out so they wouldn't rupture as I ran.  Turns out I ran
pretty darn slowly, so I don't think the stress would have burst them,
but I have no spares and am still glad that I didn't risk it.

    be hard to taste.

Wednesday 20220518 weight 152.2

I started with a 70 oz. bladder, two 500 ml soft tubes and a 20
oz. bike bottle that I put inside the main compartment of my ultra
vest. When we got to the top of the tram the first time I used the 20
oz. bottle to refill one of my soft tubes, refilled the other soft
tube from my bladder and then used the sink at the top of the tram to
refill my 20 oz, bottle, but I *did not* top up my bladder, because I
was lazy and figured I had enough water. I didn't.

I should have brought two 20 oz. bottles with me and completely topped
up at the top of the tram and then not only would I have not run out
of water, I would even have water to spare, had someone else needed
water, The additional weight wouldn't have mattered much, considering
the hydration headroom it would have given me. Live and learn.

1000 2x normal (sort of) oatmeal (without Udo's Oil) -- Costco hasn't had
     the steel cut oatmeal I normally get, so I had Quaker rolled oats.
     Additionally, we were out of soy milk, so one of my oatmeals had
     almond milk in it.  We have a lot of Quaker oats to eat, so I'll
     continue eating them, but I'm going to be on the lookout for steel
     cut oats because I greatly appreciate the old consistency.
