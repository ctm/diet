     on the taste comparison) is that the 2/3rd full one only started with
     one 200 calorie package, too.  I did not drink all 20 oz. of either

Weight was after my second poop at 6:50.  It was 162.7 after my first
around 5:20.

I did not run at 5:30 because it was cold and I didn't want to run
with large gloves which I wouldn't have a place for when I no longer
needed them.  My lightweight gloves have far too many holes in them to
be trustworthy at the 21F degrees it was at 5:30.

For the record, Ghost, my dog weighs 43.2 pounds. I decided to weigh
her because I carry her around a bunch due to her arthritis. It's not
enough to count for exercise, but it's kind of funny since that's
exceedingly close to the weight of my pack.

Woke to my alarm at 5:15.  Decided to put off the caffeine for 15
minutes so I could poop and take my heart rate and then start my core
exactly 15 minutes late.  However, I wound up pooping twice and still
missed 5:30 by 18 seconds acording to my Ambit's seconds display.

Did a deploy after my core exercises and had trouble due to
ws.devctm.com's certificate expiring.  I fixed that and then wrote up
three different GitHub issues to prevent it from causing so much
trouble in the future.  That meant I started running very late.

I did my mountain "run" today so I can do a 12-hour timed race around
Albuquerque Academy tomorrow.  My right knee is giving me a little
trouble so I chose to do it very slowly. As such, I did it fasted,
without extra caffeine, with random music (rather than my BMDM
playlist), no ice hat and fairly late in the day.  My stats were
horrible, but at least I got time on my feet and practice not falling.

Sunday 20220123 weight 160.8

Woke up too late to take my HR.  I did not sleep well last night.  I
tried to tough it out with no analgesics, but my discomfort was too
great.  By the time I took my ibuprofen it was too late to get a decen
night's sleep.  It took a while to kick in and relieve my body aches.

I seriously considered not running "Resolutions Stink!" today, but I
chose to do so and am glad (so far!) I did.  Tomorrow will be
... interesting.

Made it through the night with no analgesics, but by the time 4am
rolled around, I definitely had some body aches.  Since they were
nowhere near as bad as last night I decided to tough it out, knowing
that I'd have caffeine at 5:15 and that would get rid of them for the
remainder of the day.

So, I woke up to my alarm and didn't measure my HR before having my
espresso.  I also chose not to run today, but I did get a bunch of
programming done.

Got out the door late in part due to making Sophie a cappuccino and me
a replacement double espresso.  Additionally, I couldn't find my
GoLite tights or my Jackie tights, so I wound up wearing my REI very
loose leggings.

I chose not to bring water, even though my goal was 18.8 miles.  I
figured the cold would help reduce my water need and it did, but not
enough.  Kurt Coonrod had earlier pointed out that cold air is so dry
that you lose more water than you think due to that.  However, I
didn't want to deal with water freezng in my bottle or the fact that
drinking cold water might cool me down, but I wound up running less
that I might have had I properly hydrated, so I think I made the wrong
choice.  Basically I should always take at least one bottle when I'm
doing 15.5 or more miles.

My plans changed at the last minute. I got dressed and had my pack
prepared to go do my 24 mile 40# run when I read my email and saw that
the Tough Ruck Boston was announced.  That means I need to peak on
April 16th, rather than March 20th.  Consequently, it makes more sense
to baby my left foot and to push my 24 mile rucks out a bit.

Saturday 20220402 weight 163.8

Weight was after two tiny poops at 4:05am.  If I had kept my normal
schedule, it probably would have been closer to 163.0

I drank my double espresso early because I wanted to be on the road at
5am.  Sophie had gotten a free cup of Michael Thomas coffee the day
before but didn't drink much of it, so I also had that in the morning.

The day before I hastily threw together a bunch of stuff, including a
container of mixed nuts and a container of dates. Those were going to
be my mainstays, but I also grabbed a plastic bag full of ancient gels
and even more ancient Hammer products (a 270 calorie Perpetuem and a
couple single-use (100 calorie?) packets of Heed).

Unbeknownst to me, I didn't bring a bladder (I left it in my BMDM pack)
or the tubes that fit into the front sleeves of my ultra vest.  I did
bring 2 20 oz. handhelds and some bike water bottles. IIRC, I didn't
take any water with me on the first lap.  I don't recall the second
lap, but eventually I was doing a lap with a single handheld (and two
trekking poles) and I ran out of water at about mile 2.2. I slogged through
the rest of the loop, but instead of eating just one of the provided
oranges, I ate a bunch (four or five, I think).

I don't remember when I dumped the Heed into a bottle or when I dumped
the Perpetuem, but I definitely had too much of one or both of those
things and I was kind of bloated.  I chose to run my seventh lap with
just two handhelds with just water in them and to not use my trekking
poles.

After the sixth lap I ate a single date and then took two 200 mg
ibuprofens.  That seemed to help the tenderness in my feet, but I
think it wound up upsetting my stomach (which would then interfere
with my sleep hours later).

I did not take notes or pictures of the various things I ate, but I
also didn't eat a variety, so I suspect this is fairly close to what I
had.

Chose not to ride my bike due to wind. Perhaps a bad choice, since
wunderground isn't showing much wind yet and I could easily have
gotten in 35 miles before it picked up.  Oh well.  We were out of
coffee, so I went down to Michael Thomas at about 6:30 only to find
out they didn't open until 7am, so by the time I got back home it was
7:20.

I did wind up running out to Albuquerque Academy, then ran three loops
and back.  The wind was already picking up, so I probably got about as
much exercise as I would have had I ridden my bike, but I didn't burn
any gas to get out to the Alameda Open Space, so I'm glad I didn't
ride my bike after all.

My ultravest only weighed 7.5 pounds, because I took the bladder and
soft flasks out so they wouldn't rupture as I ran.  Turns out I ran
pretty darn slowly, so I don't think the stress would have burst them,
but I have no spares and am still glad that I didn't risk it.

    be hard to taste.

Wednesday 20220518 weight 152.2

I started with a 70 oz. bladder, two 500 ml soft tubes and a 20
oz. bike bottle that I put inside the main compartment of my ultra
vest. When we got to the top of the tram the first time I used the 20
oz. bottle to refill one of my soft tubes, refilled the other soft
tube from my bladder and then used the sink at the top of the tram to
refill my 20 oz, bottle, but I *did not* top up my bladder, because I
was lazy and figured I had enough water. I didn't.

I should have brought two 20 oz. bottles with me and completely topped
up at the top of the tram and then not only would I have not run out
of water, I would even have water to spare, had someone else needed
water, The additional weight wouldn't have mattered much, considering
the hydration headroom it would have given me. Live and learn.

     almond milk in it.  We have a lot of Quaker oats to eat, so I'll
     continue eating them, but I'm going to be on the lookout for steel
     cut oats because I greatly appreciate the old consistency.

Saturday 20220605 weight 151.6

Weight was taken relatively early.  I pooped more at the porta-potty
pre-race, so if this had been a normal day, perhaps I would have
pooped more and weighed less.  Hard to say.

I did not keep track of the temperature, but it was a bit warm for me
as I was running with my pack.  I tried dousing my shirt in water
before the race, but I got some water down the back of my shirt and
that caused my panty liner to come off.  I did not realize that I
could get the time from my watch when it was in standby mode and I had
already put away my phone, so I sort of panicked trying to get my pack
off and a new panty liner in place.

I used a single handheld that I couldn't easily drink all the liquid
out of while running at speed.  My old Ultimate Direction handhelds
were much better for that.

Monday 20220606 weight 148.9

My weight is from after my post-caffeine poop, but before my pre-run
pee at 7am, so if I had weighed myself then it'd have been closer to
148.5, which is my current target weight. If I can hit that and stay
in that ballpark for about a week, I'll try to eat more during the day
and will also take in calories for some of my exercises in an attempt
to be more awake during the day and to get my speed back up.  I'll
also look into getting hydrostatically weighed again.  Whee!

Thursday 20220609 weight 152.0

Weight was at 7:40, well after my first (and only?) double espresso.

Yesterday was rough.  I got out to a late start and only put 8.85
miles on my feet.  I experimented with eating a lot of potatos, hoping
the extra calories would give me some energy, but instead I was tired
througout the day.  I took a nap sometime after lunch and woke up at
3pm and to make things worse, I did not wake up refreshed.  I made
absolutely no progress on anything important yesterday and even missed
an important call.

I shouldn't have had all the potatos. I was lulled into a false sense
of security from eating all the burnt ones.  The burnt ones didn't
seem to affect my weight anywhere near what I expected.  The unburnt
ones appear to have.

My guess is my tiredness was due to having had three double espressos
on Tuesday and only one yesterday, although it may also have been due
to the caloric deficits I've been deliberately running.

Didn't weigh myself because I ate early because I wanted food in my
system for the double crossing I was planning on doing.  However, I
wound up with a sore stomach that got even more sore when I ate some
nuts.  My guess is the sweet potato was sufficiently bad to give me
trouble.  My stomach did get better as we were getting close to Canyon
Estates, but lightning turned our double crossing into a single
crossing.  We killed time waiting for Jason's son at Molly's Bar.

     This time I rinsed it three times and cooked it for almost an hour
     but it still wasn't that tender.  I started with 3 cups of water this
     time and added a fourth cup about 40 minutes in.  After that, I re-read
     recipes for cooking urad dal and see that it cooks much more like a bean
     than a lentil.  Next time I'll soak it over night and cook it for two or
     three hours in the cooker.

4:45 urad dal  (2/3rd cups in 3? cups water), with turmeric and Tabasco
     I let it soak overnight from about 7pm until about 8:30am.  I then
     put it in the slow cooker on high for three hours, but about fifteen
     minutes in it started boiling over and making a bit of a mess, so I
     turned it to low and let it cook for about 2:45 more.  It came out
     a little softer, but not as soft as I had imagined.  My guess is that
     the temperature was too low, but the problem is when this stuff gets
     hot, it gets messy.  I think the recommendation was to cook it in
     a saucepan, although I may be mistaken.  Either way it is not anywhere
     near as simple as green lentils or red lentils or even any of the
     beans (navy, 15-bean mix, pinto, black, anasazi, adsuki) that I prepare.
     We bought eight pounds of this, but I am going to have to figure out
     how to efficiently cook it some other time.  In the meantime, I'll
     eat red lentils and then get some more green lentils from Smith's.
     Live and learn.

I had scratchy sinuses throughout the night, but when I woke up I did
think I was going to go out and exercise.  However, by the time I
started getting ready, body-aches were overtaking me.  I wound up
sleeping (or at least *trying* to sleep) through much of the day.  I
wound up with junk in my lungs, body-aches, a fever, occasional
chills, a sore throat and a headache.  I chose not to take any
ibuprofen until 5:30pm.

Sophie normally buys the groceries, so although I've had some idea of
what my diet costs, I haven't paid close attention.  At some point I
may want to refer back to this and figure out how much, for example,
my oatmeal costs to make.  Unfortunately, the Quaker Oats brand of
oatmeal has a funny taste to it, so I've been buying Coaches Oats via
Amazon and then mixing in some of the Quaker Oats to get rid of it.

      shouldn't have eaten anything at all, however, we were under a lot
      of stress due to Jason's truck's radiator blowing, so I ordered
      a plate with a side and Jason did the same. It was very good food,
      so I ate all of mine and when Jason wasn't very hungry, I ...
      ate his leftovers, too.  Thus I completely blew my calorie budget
      for the day.  Ugh!

Before going to bed, I got everything set up for core exercise in the

down the day before, because I didn't want to wake Jason. So, I woke
up at 5:17 to a very low volume alarm.  I futzed around the room
putting things away and eventually decided to simply start my day an
hour later.

My core exercises didn't go well and I had a memory leak plaguing my
mind that I wanted to look at before running.

6:15 VERY LATE wake-up
10 double espresso

I skipped breakfast because I skipped running today.  I wanted to do
some work on the memory leak before I ran.  By the time I was done, I
decided to wait until afternoon to run, if I run at all.  It wound up
raining and I wound up being busy.

Wednesday 20220907 weight 150.4

Today was a bit weird.  It started out OK, but I had a meeting to
attend five minutes from home at 10:30.  When I realized Elvis had the
day off, I invited him to hike with me.  He accepted, so I chose to
wear my pack and go at his pace, rather than run.

We simply hiked a mile from the La Luz Trail Head, taking new La Luz
over to the first switchback, then the "secret" path to Old La Luz,
which we stayed on until we had gone a mile total, then we turned
back.

I was slightly late for my meeting due to not paying close attention
to the time after I got back.  This was an application for a
commercial bank account with Wells Fargo, and my company was turned
down, probably because our software is poker, but perhaps due to my
bad credit.  Ugh.

So, when I got back I still needed cook my crucifers and lentils,
which I started, but I chose to eat my salad a little early, since I
was disappointed with Craft Poker Co.'s rejection.

Didn't weigh myself, because I didn't poop this morning and I was
fairly eager to drive up to Salt Lake City for packet pickup.  I got off
with time to make it up there by eleven, but I wound up having to get gas
once at the only gas station for miles @ $5.79/gallon and tnen stopped
again to fill up at something like $3.89/gallon, and then my truck's
transmission died.

I may have weighed myself, but if so, I never wrote it down, whidh is a
shame, since it was race day and I definitely had my scale with me.

I did not give myself enough time to make it through the porta-potty
line in time to take another dump just before race start.  I should
have eaten earlier, packed, tied and turned in my start bag earlier
and then gotten in a porta potty line in the center rather than the
line at the end that got starved.

             fuji apples than I had planned, because there was a good
             price on a bag of them and the bag had something like eleven
             of them, so I'll be eating at least two apples a day while
             only eating one orange.

Tuesday 20220913 weight 149.9

Today I am experimenting with eating my first calories much earlier,
with a hope that I won't be so tired during the day, however, my guess
is I still will be, because a bunch of my tiredness is presumably due
to lack of sleep and bad sleep.  I got to sleep last night around
9:30, which is about an hour later than normal. I chose to have
ibuprofen at 10pm instead of 1:30am and so I slept better than the
previous night, but it still wasn't very good sleep due to a
combination of knee discomfort and worrying about finances.

5:15 wake-up

7:15 no exercise (not even core :-(, much less running) breakfast
350?  1/2 cup steel cut oats prepared in 2 cups water, with about 1/2 cup
      of unsweetened soy milk added afterward.  Still trying to figure
      out a good value for the microwave, but setting the power at 4 of 7
      for 30 minutes was much better than 4 for 7 minutes, although there
      was some boil-over slop, so I'm going to try 3 (of 7) for 30 minutes

8:00 more oatmeal (& avocado)
350?  1/2 cup steel cut oats prepared in 2 cups water, with about 1/2
      cup of unsweetened soy milk added afterward.  Still trying to
      figure out a good value for the microwave, but setting the power
      at 3 of 7 for 30 minutes gave me no slop, but the oatmeal didn't
      puff out as much, either.  The microwave doesn't have a 3.5
      setting, so tomorrow I will try continuing to use 3, but with a
      little less water and more time.

I managed to make it through the night without taking ibuprofen, but
with much sleeplessness due to a combination of left knee discomfort
and minor body aches.  I associate the type of body aches I had with
caffeine withdrawal, but I haven't backed off my caffeine.  I don't
think I'm sick, so I don't have an explanation, although I have been
on my back a lot in bed due to the lack of a comfy chair at the Airbnb
I'm staying in.

Yipes: the following are from photos, but the estimated ounces are
guesses.  Mostly we were opening twelve ounce bottles and sharing them
amonst several people, so 3 oz. may actually be high, but all the junk
food was eaten totally by me.  They were small packages, but I ate many.

10:00 - noon post flight libations (and drunkin' eating)

I may have eaten other stuff other than the nut snack, but I don't
*think* I did.  As I sobered up I realized I had completely pigged out
on junk food, so I skipped making and eating lentils, but I still
gained three and a half pounds.  FWIW, I was celebrating my having had
a turn to go up in Lofty and also I thought it was unlikely they were
going to hold the Feral Hog 50k (but I was wrong about that).  Still,
I need to exercise more self restraint in the future.

weight was at 4:36 after pooping but before espresso

My fingers and then my fingers and hands got a bit swollen during the
race.  My suspicion is that I was eating too much salty food for the
temperature and I was retaining water.  I never felt nauseous or
sluggish and I was peeing fairly regularly, so I don't think I was in
the danger zone, but I probably would have altered my intake if the
race were to have gone on longer than it did.

Two days of toothache, bad post race eating and drinking caused my
weight to balloon.  Some of it is all the rolls I ate for buffer.
Some of it is the inappropriate food I ate while drinking.  Some of it
is that I didn't run far, so I didn't burn off many calories, but I
ran hard, so I felt like I needed to eat a lot.

Hard to tell what my weight was, because I was using my bathroom scale in
my tent.  The tent doesn't have a solid floor and I got the following
inconsistent readings:

154.0 4:44 after pooping and eating half my oatmeal (also in the tent)

I did not log my food intake until Wednesday, November 2nd, which means
I probably forgot a lot.  I did, however, write

NOTE: I did not write down what I ate at the time, nor did I take pictures.
I didn't even attempt to recall everything until Wednesday, November 9th
due to my toothache, second half of root canal and other time sinks.

I did not eat any of my own calories during the run.  I did not have
any of their tailwind, either.  There was no avocado or nuts on
course.  The only non-vegan things I ate, AFAIK, were a bunch of
tootsie rolls at the halfway point and some cherry pie (which might
have been vegan, but probably wasn't) at the La Ventana Mesa aid
station on my way back in.
