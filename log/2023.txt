This was initially a single file until it got too large.  There's
some info in 2018.txt that explains a bit about what is going on here.

Sunday 20230101 weight 164.1

weight was at 5:28, just before breakfast

As usual, I didn't write down everything I ate during or even after
the race.  I had an external battery pack for my phone, which I used,
so I *should* have simply snapped a shot of everything before I put it
in my mouth.  I'll see if I can remember to do that for the Sandia
Snowshoe Race.  The Quad will be trickier.

Monday 20230102 163.3

I did not sleep well the night before, in part due to the extra caffeine
I had during the race, in part due to body aches associated with fighting
off whatever Sophie and Elvis had but also due to Ghost's troubles.  I
wound up staying in all day.

I haven't yet made salads, green drinks or oatmeal.  My food for today is
a bit weird, in part due to wanting to finish off leftovers so there's more
room in the refrigerator and in part due to my stomach being upset.

Tuesday 20230103 weight 163.0

Another poor night of sleep last night, but I wound up not exercising in part
due to needing to get to the bank early because the bank's web-site said
my account was overdrawn (it wasn't).  When I got back, I chose to finish
putting stuff away from the Foothills Fat Ass.  I probably should have done
*some* exercise (perhaps just my push-ups), but I didn't.

Another night of poor sleep, at least starting at 2:30am.  I tried
letting Ghost sleep on my bed with me but her twitching and running in
her sleep disturbed mine.  I briefly put her back down in her bed, but
she whined.  I understand she's in physical discomfort sometimes, but
I think much of her whining has more to do with insecurity.  The nice
thing is that her insecurity can be quelled by me being near.  The
downside is loss of sleep.
