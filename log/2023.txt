This was initially a single file until it got too large.  There's
some info in 2018.txt that explains a bit about what is going on here.

Sunday 20230101 weight 164.1

weight was at 5:28, just before breakfast

As usual, I didn't write down everything I ate during or even after
the race.  I had an external battery pack for my phone, which I used,
so I *should* have simply snapped a shot of everything before I put it
in my mouth.  I'll see if I can remember to do that for the Sandia
Snowshoe Race.  The Quad will be trickier.

Monday 20230102 163.3

I did not sleep well the night before, in part due to the extra caffeine
I had during the race, in part due to body aches associated with fighting
off whatever Sophie and Elvis had but also due to Ghost's troubles.  I
wound up staying in all day.

5:15 wake-up

I haven't yet made salads, green drinks or oatmeal.  My food for today is
a bit weird, in part due to wanting to finish off leftovers so there's more
room in the refrigerator and in part due to my stomach being upset.

Tuesday 20230103 weight 163.0

Another poor night of sleep last night, but I wound up not exercising in part
due to needing to get to the bank early because the bank's web-site said
my account was overdrawn (it wasn't).  When I got back, I chose to finish
putting stuff away from the Foothills Fat Ass.  I probably should have done
*some* exercise (perhaps just my push-ups), but I didn't.

Another night of poor sleep, at least starting at 2:30am.  I tried
letting Ghost sleep on my bed with me but her twitching and running in
her sleep disturbed mine.  I briefly put her back down in her bed, but
she whined.  I understand she's in physical discomfort sometimes, but
I think much of her whining has more to do with insecurity.  The nice
thing is that her insecurity can be quelled by me being near.  The
downside is loss of sleep.

Thursday 20230105 weight 160.0

weight was at 6:43 just before my final set of push-ups

I slept better than I had the two previous nights, but Ghost still got
me up at about 4am.  OTOH, this time she didn't keep me up too long,
just long enough to take her outside, then hurry her back to bed after
she went potty.

Wound up not exercising after all.  Wound up chatting with Sophie
about Costco and Ghost, then spent a little time comforting Ghost and
researching euthanization and burial for dogs.  Lost steam.

Friday 20230106 weight 159.7

weight was 160.0 at 6:51
weight was at 9:04

Chose not to exercise as an experiment.  I did not exercise the day
before my 21 mile ruck run in 2019 or 2021 and those are the two dates
when I had my fasted pace.  I'm at a comparable weight to what I was
then, so I'm going to try to eat comparably to what I ate in 2021.
2019 was faster, but would be much harder to reproduce, because it was
at an Albuquerque Road Runners dinner, where I ate two salads, then
came back and had nuts.

weight was 161.3 at 5:10 post small poop, pre-caffeine, pre-oatmeal
I pooped a pound at 5:30, after I had already had some of my oatmeal,
so I backed my weight down to 160.3

I got off to a late start.  Ghost had some trouble at midnight, so I
carried her a bit and also wound up letting her sleep on the bed with
me.  I lost about an hour of sleep.  This morning, before leaving to
run I had a discussion with Sophie about Ghost.  Getting off to a
later start may have made it a bit warmer, but the thing that slowed
me down the most was the hot-spot in my right foot.

having my green drink and only eventually made a single salad, meaning
I started Monday with no pre-made salads or green drinks.

try jotting down the time I close my laptop.  It did register two
fairly lengthy timds I was awake in the night and those I think are
accurate.  My guess is they're related to the 3 double espressos I had
yesterday.

Friday 20230127 weight 160.6

Wound up not exercising today.  I was initially planning on doing 5.6
miles before the sun came up and then doing it again once or twice
during the day, but I chose to go back to bed, then I let the day
slowly drift away.  I chose not to eat until when I start cooking my
lunch, so I weighed myself each time I took a leak.

I actually woke up at 5:14 and was able to have my espresso in my
mouth by the time my alarm went off at 5:15.  Coros claims I was in
REM from 5:14 to 5:18.  So, at least in this instance, it's clear
that the app can claim time awake was in REM, which may mean that
it's not dinging my total sleep time by enough for all the times
I get up to go to pee, but I don't yet have a way to confirm.

NOTE: I probably had 20 to 30 minutes of sleep after I closed my
laptop and before I woke up for about a half hour.  However, I think
it was a sufficiently small amount of sleep compared to the awake that
the Coros app threw it all away, which is why it claims my sleep
started at 10:01.  I did wake up for long periods of time, and that
was due to a combination of the caffeine and lingering foot
discomfort.

Looks like it chopped off some sleep due to me falling asleep and then
waking up again.  I didn't write down when I closed my laptop, but I
had gone to the Albuquerque Road Runners meeting and ate my final
calories soon after I got back.  I don't think I *immediately* closed
my laptop, so I probably got around a half hour of sleep.  OTOH, I
think I was probably awake more like 4:45 rather than 4:53, so overall
I probably got closer to seven hours rather than eight, due to the
caffeine I had for my pack run and the ARR meeting.

Wednesday 20230517 weight 162.8

weight was at 5:30?

Yesterday, eating out threw me off balance and I wound up eating a
bunch *after* eating out.  The eating out itself didn't push up my
weight, but the rest of what I ate did.  Oh well, it was my mom's 91st
birthday and I'm glad I went.  It also revealed that because I now eat
out so infrequently, I've lost what little
eating-out-balancing-during-the-remainder-of-the-day skill I formerly
had.  I.e., I'm doing poorly, but that leaves plenty of room for
improvement.

    I went to La Montañita Co-op and bought some lentils there.  I
    bought two different types, and this was the more expensive of two
    @ $3.29/pound.  These look and taste comparable to what I had been
    getting at Sprouts before they got the nasty ones. The less
    expensive (@ $2.49/lb.) ones are smaller and look a little more
    like what I used to get at Smith's or Walmart.  I haven't tried
    them yet.
