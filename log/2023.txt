This was initially a single file until it got too large.  There's
some info in 2018.txt that explains a bit about what is going on here.

Sunday 20230101 weight 164.1

weight was at 5:28, just before breakfast

As usual, I didn't write down everything I ate during or even after
the race.  I had an external battery pack for my phone, which I used,
so I *should* have simply snapped a shot of everything before I put it
in my mouth.  I'll see if I can remember to do that for the Sandia
Snowshoe Race.  The Quad will be trickier.

Monday 20230102 163.3

I did not sleep well the night before, in part due to the extra caffeine
I had during the race, in part due to body aches associated with fighting
off whatever Sophie and Elvis had but also due to Ghost's troubles.  I
wound up staying in all day.

5:15 wake-up

I haven't yet made salads, green drinks or oatmeal.  My food for today is
a bit weird, in part due to wanting to finish off leftovers so there's more
room in the refrigerator and in part due to my stomach being upset.

Tuesday 20230103 weight 163.0

Another poor night of sleep last night, but I wound up not exercising in part
due to needing to get to the bank early because the bank's web-site said
my account was overdrawn (it wasn't).  When I got back, I chose to finish
putting stuff away from the Foothills Fat Ass.  I probably should have done
*some* exercise (perhaps just my push-ups), but I didn't.

34.3F 68% humidity at finish

Another night of poor sleep, at least starting at 2:30am.  I tried
letting Ghost sleep on my bed with me but her twitching and running in
her sleep disturbed mine.  I briefly put her back down in her bed, but
she whined.  I understand she's in physical discomfort sometimes, but
I think much of her whining has more to do with insecurity.  The nice
thing is that her insecurity can be quelled by me being near.  The
downside is loss of sleep.

Thursday 20230105 weight 160.0

weight was at 6:43 just before my final set of push-ups

I slept better than I had the two previous nights, but Ghost still got
me up at about 4am.  OTOH, this time she didn't keep me up too long,
just long enough to take her outside, then hurry her back to bed after
she went potty.

Wound up not exercising after all.  Wound up chatting with Sophie
about Costco and Ghost, then spent a little time comforting Ghost and
researching euthanization and burial for dogs.  Lost steam.

Friday 20230106 weight 159.7

weight was 160.0 at 6:51
weight was at 9:04

Chose not to exercise as an experiment.  I did not exercise the day
before my 21 mile ruck run in 2019 or 2021 and those are the two dates
when I had my fasted pace.  I'm at a comparable weight to what I was
then, so I'm going to try to eat comparably to what I ate in 2021.
2019 was faster, but would be much harder to reproduce, because it was
at an Albuquerque Road Runners dinner, where I ate two salads, then
came back and had nuts.

weight was 161.3 at 5:10 post small poop, pre-caffeine, pre-oatmeal
I pooped a pound at 5:30, after I had already had some of my oatmeal,
so I backed my weight down to 160.3

I got off to a late start.  Ghost had some trouble at midnight, so I
carried her a bit and also wound up letting her sleep on the bed with
me.  I lost about an hour of sleep.  This morning, before leaving to
run I had a discussion with Sophie about Ghost.  Getting off to a
later start may have made it a bit warmer, but the thing that slowed
me down the most was the hot-spot in my right foot.
