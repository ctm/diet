Saturday 20240106 weight 158.5 28F (van thermometer)
37F at end (van thermometer)

weight was at 5:30, just before eating my oatmeal

NOTE: today's run started out very nice, but I started slowing down a
little bit before the turnaround. I figured that the quad espresso
would speed me back up, but it was in my pocket and I actually had to
stop to get it out and drink it, then, to make matters worse, I wound
up slowing down still, and it wasn't super clear what was going on
although increasingly I felt like I had to take a dump, so at mile
15.5, I did just that. At that point, I had averaged a 9:48 min/mile,
including the various slowdowns and the tiny stop at the turnaround.

Unfortunately, I think taking my pack off and putting it on again made
my chafing worse, although my shirt appeared to be a bit bloody even
before I did that, so I'm not exactly sure what's going on there.
Although my GI system felt much more comfortable after the dump, I
still had a hard time getting my speed and HR back up to where they
should be. I'm guessing that was due to a combination of my right knee
and the chafing, although there's also a chance that I'm fighting off
whatever made Margaret sick that seems to also be biting Elvis. I
definitely woke up this morning with a minor headache and that's
pretty rare for me.

Anyway, seeing how I lost BMDM 2023 due to a porta-potty visit and I
also had to slow down my BMDM training run last week due to a full
gut, I think I can no longer eat *any* fortified oatmeal on my
Saturday BMDM trainings and on BMDM itself.  I also will want to
review my Friday consumption, although to be fair, yesterday and
today were patterned on what I did for my first 24 miler in 2021,
because I did exceedingly well on that run.  I do think that my
available gut capacity has changed since then though.
