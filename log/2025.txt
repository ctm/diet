28F (van thermometer) at end

weight was at 6:57, just before pre-run bonus bonus caffeine

Went to sleep around 8pm, but woke up before midnight, IIRC, and had a
hard time getting back to sleep. I had been wearing my watch to track
my sleep time, *but* the wristband was a bit too tight, so I wound up
taking it off eventually. The 1:02am above for when I ate the dates is
accurate, but I don't remember how soon after eating them I got back
to sleep.

I've had a lot of trouble sleeping lately, but I haven't been logging
my sleep, because It's been a while since I've done that and my
experiment with doing it again was not going well due to the
possibility of the wrist-band exacerbating the situation.

my three “Monday morning pack interval” double espressos, but now I’m
in a holding pattern.

I weighed myself at 5:26 or so, but forgot to write my weight down at the

FWIW, I'm trying to eat fairly similarly to how I ate on February
26th, 2021, which was the day before a fairly good (9:57 min/mi) late
February 24 mile ruck run. In 2022 I didn't do a late February 24
miler due to trouble with my *left* foot. In 2023, my (still
problematic, two years later, but I've made some progress) right foot
slowed me down to 12:31 min/mi, and last year I had a dental emergency
and "ran" (11:49 min/mi pace) it AMA (Against Medical Advice).

3:30 time to get "things" moving
10 double espresso
533 fortified oatmeal

I don't remember everything I ate at the aid stations.  I do know that
the only "food" (not counting double espresso) of my own that I
consumed was three gels.  Initially my liquid was simply water, but I
only had two 500ml tubes of water leaving Ice Rink and that was not
nearly enough to get me to Mitchell.  I ran out and I got *very*
thirsty and my mouth got so dry that swallowing was tricky.

Pipeline had potatoes, so I thought I would basically subsist on them,
but it turns out many (most?) of the other aid stations didn't have
potatoes, so in general my go-to was PB&J.  I do know I ate some flat
pretzels somewhere and also grabbed a handful of jelly beans on two
different occasions.  There were also some sort of sugary snacks that
had little confeciton balls on them that I had.

    for more than an hour, I think, 2 teaspoons turmeric, 1/2
    teaspoons black pepper, Taos Hum (chocolate Trinidad moruga
    scorpion hot sauce).  Trying to figure out how to do pinto beans in
    the new-to-me slow cooker.  My old slow cooker burnt and the new one
    cooks so much hotter than 3 cups of water cooks off in about an hour,
    so perhaps I need 9 cups of water?  I'm trying 10 cups now

    that will probably be too much, but I don't want to damage the cooker
    by running out of water.

    starting with water to the 4 line.  The water cooked off in an hour
    or two, so I added a bunch more water, but I never saw steam come
    out again, so even though the timer continued to count down, I don't
    think the heating element was ever started again.  Unsurprisingly,
    when the 3 hours were up, there was basically the same amount of water
    I had added and the beans were room temperature and undercooked.

I accidentally broke the chain that turns on the ceiling fan in the
room I sleep in and that meant my room was too hot last night.  The
temperature and my whining foot led to poor sleep.  My *suspicion* is
that had it been cooler, I'd have slept better.  The break is inside
the housing, so I can't just add an extension to what remains of a
broken chain.  I do not yet have time to take the housing off and see
if I can replace the chain.

I had a really hard time getting back to sleep sometime around 11pm. I
was *super* tempted to open my laptop to distract myself, but I pushed
through it and eventually got to sleep w/o reading news, programming
or eating something. In the long run, I believe I will benefit from
that self-discipline, but I do expect to be tired later today due to
my lack of sleep.

    spicy (but not "hot hot") achar (sp?), 2 teaspoons turmeric, 1/2
    teaspoons black pepper, brick of tofu, cauliflower -- I forgot to
    add the lentils after adding the spices to the water. I didn't
    notice the omission until I took the pan off the stove.  Since
    much of the water boiled away, I figured the spices were at a good
    concentration for "soup", so I added a 1/2 brick of tofu, ate that
    bowl, then added the other 1/2 as well as all my cauliflower
    (which I started steaming as soon as I had poured the spice mix
    into a bowl).  It tasted OK.  I'll make non-spicy lentils for
    dinner this evening.

    with (accidentally?) too much water, 1 teaspoon of "new: hot
    achar, 2 teaspoons turmeric, 1/2 teaspoons black pepper. I thought
    I was starting with water to halfway point between the 6 line and
    7 line, which has worked in the past, because most of the water
    boils off. However, after three hours, there was a ton of water
    left, which makes me think that either I put in more water
    (perhaps past the 8 line?)  or for some reason the cooker didn't
    stay as hot as it typically does for the entire three hours.
    FWIW, using the hot achar was an experiment to see what the flavor
    was and it worked OK, but nowhere near as well as the Naga King
    hot hot pickle.  However, since Bombay Spice has no more Naga King
    hot hot pickle, I'm experimenting with substitutes.  I did not drink
    all the excess bean water in one sitting

could check on WSER people again, then I went back to sleep.  I do
think that my second double espresso yesterday interfered with my
sleep, although I *probably* would have slept a little more / better
had I not taken it in conjunction with WSER.

    with 2 cups of water and the hemp and chia i the slow cooker on slow,
    stopping it after 10 minutes. This came out a good consistency and
    just a little too hot to eat without letting it cool slightly.  Yay!

    been perfect.  A ton of green chile.
