28F (van thermometer) at end

weight was at 6:57, just before pre-run bonus bonus caffeine

Went to sleep around 8pm, but woke up before midnight, IIRC, and had a
hard time getting back to sleep. I had been wearing my watch to track
my sleep time, *but* the wristband was a bit too tight, so I wound up
taking it off eventually. The 1:02am above for when I ate the dates is
accurate, but I don't remember how soon after eating them I got back
to sleep.

I've had a lot of trouble sleeping lately, but I haven't been logging
my sleep, because It's been a while since I've done that and my
experiment with doing it again was not going well due to the
possibility of the wrist-band exacerbating the situation.

Today is starting off a bit strangely. There’s a cop at the corner of

half-way to Monroe with the other at Monroe.

The nearest one told me “Sir, go inside” when I went out to check the
temperature using the van’s thermometer. I had already quaffed two of
my three “Monday morning pack interval” double espressos, but now I’m
in a holding pattern.
