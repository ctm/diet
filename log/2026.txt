This was initially a single file until it got too large.  There's
some info in 2018.txt that explains a bit about what is going on here.

Thursday 20260101 weight 162.3
weight was at 5:24

5:15 wake-up
10 double espresso

5:25 pre-run breakfast
533 fortified oatmeal

I believe I recorded everything I ate during my run, but I didn't log
my plain (i.e., non Tailwind) water, which I think came exclusively
from my right 500ml tube, which I had maybe 1/2 of before hitting
Menaul Trailhead north, which I then refilled and had about half of
when I finished (I didn't think to check before I emptied both tubes
after getting back to 4744).  I do not know precisely how much
Tailwind water I started with, due to a bunch of it being leftover
from my previous day's speed run.

FWIW, I had a ton of food in my ultravest that I never touched,
including two 3 oz. baggies of dry roasted mixed nuts, one baggie of
pistachios and a ton of gels.  The only thing I ate from my vest was
the sweet potato, three gels and my Tailwind water.  I think I would
have run much faster if I had adjusted my orthotic in my right shoe
earlier, taken ibuprofen earlier, eaten properly the day before ane
had a nutrition and hydration plan.

This one I don't have a time for, because I didn't write down when I started

nursing it after Embudito and the sweet potato and I *think* I had my last
drop *after* the gels

FWIW, I did weigh myself, but didn't write down my weight at the time
because I was a bit tired and distracted. I also thought I'd weigh
myself when I got back from walking with mom, but I forgot that, too.

??? 2/3rd cup dried pinto beans cooked for three hours in the slow cooker
    starting with water at between the 3 and 4 line after the beans. Heaping
    teaspoon of Naga King Hot Hot Pickle. Once again, the slow cooker fucked up
    (it often does) and boiled away too much water, so I added a cup of water
    when it was running low.  At the end of three hours there was a little
    excess water, but the beans themselves were undercooked.  I need to get
    a replacement cooker, because this one is not consistent.
