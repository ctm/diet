# Mostly unformatted, at least for now

The files in this directory are basically for my own use.  Initially I
just logged what I was eating, then I decided to put that log on
GitHub.  In the past, every once in a while I'd point someone to my
log for some reason (typically because that person was contemplating a
plant-based diet).

## Maybe someday I'll clean it up more

Eventually the file got too large, so I split it into several
different files.  The top of [2018.txt](2018.txt) contains some
information that was at the top of the single file.  I have not yet
reviewed to see how current it is.
