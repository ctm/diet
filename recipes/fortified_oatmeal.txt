This is a staple of my diet.  I tend to eat two portions after my morning
exercise when I'm exercising in a fasted state.  The ingredients for one
portion are:

1/3 cup uncooked oatmeal
1 cup water
two tablespoons chia seeds
two tablespoon hemp hearts
1 cup unsweetened soy milk
(optional) 1 tablespoon Udo's 3-6-9

Put 1/3 cup uncooked oatmeal with 1 cup water in a microwave safe bowl.

On our (approximately 1,200 watt) microwave I cook at 50% power for
three and a half minutes.

After it's been microwaved, add the chia, the hemp and the unsweetened
soy milk.  Stir and try to get all the chia wet and not sticking
together.

Pour into suitable (e.g., zip-loc) container with lid, then put in
the refrigerator for several hours.  If I'm at home, I typically make
my oatmeal for the following day while I'm eating my current day's
serving(s).  If I'm at a race, I typically take a small ice chest
and keep my oatmeal on ice. So, usually my oatmeal has been in the
refrigerator overnight.

We buy our chia and hemp from Costco. We used to buy Coach's Oats from
Costco too, but in mid 2022 they haven't had any.  This may be due to
some trouble with Canada's oat crop.  Coach's Oats are steel cut but
fairly inexpensive when purchased at Costco.  I tried getting a bunch
of inexpensive Quaker rolled oats from Costco, but I did not like
their consistency, smell or perceived taste.

When prepared with Coach's Oats, eating my fortified oatmeal after
exercise tastes to me as good as (but definitely not as sweet as)
eating cake.  When prepared with the rolled oats, it's more like
eating paste.  My guess is the rolled oats are just as nutritious, but
I've taken to buying Coach's Oats from Amazon until Costco carries
them again (knock on wood).

I used to always add a half tablespoon full of Udo's 3-6-9 Oil to my
oatmeal.  I suspected that the additional fat was beneficial.
However, it got pricey and I stopped (at least for a while) using it.
It's hard to tell if it has affected my performance, because when I
stopped was during training for the Cocodona 250 and C250 training is
very different from other training.  My top speed definitely went down
during this time, but it's much more likely due to the change in
training than my change in diet.  OTOH, when I have more spending
money, I'll probably add the Udo's Oil back in.
