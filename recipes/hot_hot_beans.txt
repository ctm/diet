My brother-in-law Jeff turned me on to Nicobena "Mr. Naga King" Super
Hot Hot Pickle.  Here in Albuquerque, you can get it at Bombay Spice
https://bombayspiceabq.com/ for $5 a jar.

Here's what a jar looks like:

Mr. Naga King is extremely hot, so don't futz around with it if you
don't like super hot food.  However, I love the taste that it adds to
pinto beans. I've tried adding it to lentils and I prefer other hot
sauce with lentils, but this stuff in pinto beans is the bomb.

2/3rd cup pinto beans
3 cups water
1 teaspoon of Mr. Naga King

Heat in slow cooker on high for 3 hours.

Whee!
