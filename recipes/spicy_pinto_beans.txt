Bombay Spice ran out o Nicobena "Mr. Naga King" Super Hot Hot Pickle.
In the meantime, Jason turned me on to turmeric and black pepper and I
accidentally destroyed our old slow cooker.  So, this is what I make
instead of Hot Hot Beans.


2/3rd cup pinto beans
3 cups water
a bit of Taos Hum Chocolate Trinidad Moruga Scorpion Hot Sauce

Add the beans to the new slow cooker and then add water to half way
between the 6 and 7 line.  Slow cook for three hours.

Whee!

Salsa Saint https://www.salsasaint.com/shop/hot-sauce/7 used to have
the Taos Hum Chocolate Trinidad Moruga Scorpion Hot Sauce and perhaps
they still do, but their web site has listed it as out of stock for a
long time, so rather than go there and be disappointed, I've ordered
directly from Taos Hum for my last few bottles.

I like Salsa Saint and Taos Hum quite a bit. I don't get any discounts
or other benefit from mentioning them by name and so few people read
stuff like this that I doubt they get any benefit from me mentioning
them either.
